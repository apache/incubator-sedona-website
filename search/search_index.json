GeoSpark Viz None v1.0.0 \u00b6 GeoSpark Core Add GeoSparkConf class to read GeoSparkConf from SparkConf GeoSpark SQL Initial release: fully supports SQL/MM-Part3 Spatial SQL standard GeoSpark Viz Republish GeoSpark Viz under \"GeoSparkViz\" folder. All \"Babylon\" strings have been replaced to \"GeoSparkViz\" v0.9.1 (GeoSpark-core) \u00b6 Bug fixes : Fixed \"Missing values when reading Shapefile\": Issue #141 Performance improvement : Solved Issue #91 , #103 , #104 , #125 , #150 . Add GeoSpark customized Kryo Serializer to significantly reduce memory footprint. This serializer which follows Shapefile compression rule takes less memory than the default Kryo. See PR 139 . Delete the duplicate removal by using Reference Point concept. This eliminates one data shuffle but still guarantees the accuracy. See PR 131 . New Functionalities added : SpatialJoinQueryFlat/DistanceJoinQueryFlat returns the join query in a flat way following database iteration model: Each row has fixed two members [Polygon, Point]. This API is more efficient for unbalanced length of join results. The left and right shapes in Range query, Distance query, Range join query, Distance join query can be switched. The index side in Range query, Distance query, Range join query, Distance join query can be switched. The generic SpatialRdd supports heterogenous geometries Add KDB-Tree spatial partitioning method which is more balanced than Quad-Tree Range query, Distance query, Range join query, Distance join query, KNN query supports heterogenous inputs. v0.8.2 (GeoSpark-core) \u00b6 Bug fixes : Fix the shapefile RDD null pointer bug when running in cluster mode. See Issue https://github.com/DataSystemsLab/GeoSpark/issues/115 New function added : Provide granular control to SpatialRDD sampling utils. SpatialRDD has a setter and getter for a parameter called \"sampleNumber\". The user can manually specify the sample size for spatial partitioning. v0.8.1 (GeoSpark-core) \u00b6 Bug fixes : (1) Fix the blank DBF attribute error when load DBF along with SHX file. (2) Allow user to call CRS transformation function at any time. Previously, it was only allowed in GeoSpark constructors v0.8.0 (GeoSpark-core) \u00b6 New input format added : GeoSpark is able to load and query ESRI ShapeFile (.shp, .shx, .dbf) from local disk and HDFS! Users first need to build a Shapefile RDD by giving Spark Context and an input path then call ShapefileRDD.getSpatialRDD to retrieve Spatial RDD. ( Scala Example , Java Example ) Join Query Performance enhancement 1 : GeoSpark provides a new Quad-Tree Spatial Partitioning method to speed up Join Query. Users need to pass GridType.QUADTREE parameter to RDD1.spatialPartitioning() function. Then users need to use RDD1.partitionTree in RDD2.spatialPartitioning() function. This Quad-Tree partitioning method (1) avoids overflowed spatial objects when partitioning spatial objects. (2) checking a spatial object against the Quad-Tree grids is completed in a log complexity tree search. ( Scala Example , Java Example ) Join Query Performance enhancement 2 : Internally, GeoSpark uses zipPartitions instead of CoGroup to join two Spatial RDD so that the incurred shuffle overhead decreases. SpatialRDD Initialization Performance enhancement : GeoSpark uses mapPartition instead of flatMapToPair to generate Spatial Objects. This will speed up the calculation. API changed : Since it chooses mapPartition API in mappers, GeoSpark no longer supports the old user supplified format mapper. However, if you are using your own format mapper for old GeoSpark version, you just need to add one more loop to fit in GeoSpark 0.8.0. Please see GeoSpark user supplied format mapper examples Alternative SpatialRDD constructor added : GeoSpark no longer forces users to provide StorageLevel parameter in their SpatialRDD constructors. This will siginicantly accelerate all Spatial RDD initialization. If he only needs Spatial Range Query and KNN query, the user can totally remove this parameter from their constructors. If he needs Spatial Join Query or Distance Join Query but he knows his dataset boundary and approximate total count, the user can also remove StorageLevel parameter and append a Envelope type dataset boundary and an approxmiate total count as additional parameters. If he needs Spatial Join Query or Distance Join Query but knows nothing about his dataset , the user still has to pass StorageLevel parameter. Bug fix : Fix bug Issue #97 and Issue #100 . v0.1 - v0.7 \u00b6 Version Summary 0.7.0 Coordinate Reference System (CRS) Transformation (aka. Coordinate projection) added: GeoSpark allows users to transform the original CRS (e.g., degree based coordinates such as EPSG:4326 and WGS84) to any other CRS (e.g., meter based coordinates such as EPSG:3857) so that it can accurately process both geographic data and geometrical data. Please specify your desired CRS in GeoSpark Spatial RDD constructor ( Example ); Unnecessary dependencies removed : NetCDF/HDF support depends on SerNetCDF . SetNetCDF becomes optional dependency to reduce fat jar size; Default JDK/JRE change to JDK/JRE 1.8 : To satisfy CRS transformation requirement, GeoSpark is compiled by JDK 1.8 by default; Bug fix : fix a small format bug when output spatial RDD to disk. 0.6.2 New input format added: Add a new input format mapper called EarthdataHDFPointMapper so that GeoSpark can load, query and save NASA Petabytes NetCDF/HDF Earth Data ( Scala Example , Java Example ); Bug fix: Print UserData attribute when output Spatial RDDs as GeoJSON or regular text file 0.6.1 Bug fixes: Fix typos LineString DistanceJoin API 0.6.0 Major updates: (1) DistanceJoin is merged into JoinQuery. GeoSpark now supports complete DistanceJoin between Points, Polygons, and LineStrings. (2) Add Refine Phase to Spatial Range and Join Query. Use real polygon coordinates instead of its MBR to filter the final results. API changes: All spatial range and join queries now take a parameter called ConsiderBoundaryIntersection . This will tell GeoSpark whether returns the objects intersect with windows. 0.5.3 Bug fix: Fix Issue #69 : Now, if two objects have the same coordinates but different non-spatial attributes (UserData), GeoSpark treats them as different objects. 0.5.2 Bug fix: Fix Issue #58 and Issue #60 ; Performance enhancement: (1) Deprecate all old Spatial RDD constructors. See the JavaDoc here . (2) Recommend the new SRDD constructors which take an additional RDD storage level and automatically cache rawSpatialRDD to accelerate internal SRDD analyze step 0.5.1 Bug fix: (1) GeoSpark: Fix inaccurate KNN result when K is large (2) GeoSpark: Replace incompatible Spark API call Issue #55 ; (3) Babylon: Remove JPG output format temporarily due to the lack of OpenJDK support 0.5.0 Major updates: We are pleased to announce the initial version of Babylon a large-scale in-memory geospatial visualization system extending GeoSpark. Babylon and GeoSpark are integrated together. You can just import GeoSpark and enjoy! More details are available here: Babylon GeoSpatial Visualization 0.4.0 Major updates: ( Example ) 1. Refactor constrcutor API usage. 2. Simplify Spatial Join Query API. 3. Add native support for LineStringRDD; Functionality enhancement: 1. Release the persist function back to users. 2. Add more exception explanations. 0.3.2 Functionality enhancement: 1. JTSplus Spatial Objects now carry the original input data. Each object stores \"UserData\" and provides getter and setter. 2. Add a new SpatialRDD constructor to transform a regular data RDD to a spatial partitioned SpatialRDD. 0.3.1 Bug fix: Support Apache Spark 2.X version, fix a bug which results in inaccurate results when doing join query, add more unit test cases 0.3 Major updates: Significantly shorten query time on spatial join for skewed data; Support load balanced spatial partitioning methods (also serve as the global index); Optimize code for iterative spatial data mining 0.2 Improve code structure and refactor API 0.1 Support spatial range, join and Knn GeoSpark-Viz (old) \u00b6 Version Summary 0.2.2 Add the support of new output storage : Now the user is able to output gigapixel or megapixel resolution images (image tiles or stitched single image) to HDFS and Amazon S3. Please use the new ImageGenerator not the BabylonImageGenerator class. 0.2.1 Performance enhancement : significantly accelerate single image generation pipeline. Bug fix :fix a bug in scatter plot parallel rendering. 0.2.0 API updates for Issue #80 : 1. Babylon now has two different OverlayOperators for raster image and vector image: RasterOverlayOperator and VectorOverlayOperator; 2. Babylon merged old SparkImageGenerator and NativeJavaGenerator into a new BabylonImageGenerator which has neat APIs; New feature: Babylon can use Scatter Plot to visualize NASA Petabytes NetCDF/HDF format Earth Data. ( Scala Example , Java Example ) 0.1.1 Major updates: Babylon supports vector image and outputs SVG image format 0.1.0 Major updates: Babylon initial version supports raster images","title":"Release notes"},{"location":"archive/download/GeoSpark-All-Modules-Release-notes/#v131","text":"This version includes the official release of GeoSpark Python wrapper.

(2) checking a spatial object against the Quad-Tree grids is completed in a log complexity tree search. ( Scala Example , Java Example ) Join Query Performance enhancement 2 : Internally, GeoSpark uses zipPartitions instead of CoGroup to join two Spatial RDD so that the incurred shuffle overhead decreases. SpatialRDD Initialization Performance enhancement : GeoSpark uses mapPartition instead of flatMapToPair to generate Spatial Objects. This will speed up the calculation. API changed : Since it chooses mapPartition API in mappers, GeoSpark no longer supports the old user supplified format mapper. However, if you are using your own format mapper for old GeoSpark version, you just need to add one more loop to fit in GeoSpark 0.8.0. Please see GeoSpark user supplied format mapper examples Alternative SpatialRDD constructor added : GeoSpark no longer forces users to provide StorageLevel parameter in their SpatialRDD constructors. This will siginicantly accelerate all Spatial RDD initialization. If he only needs Spatial Range Query and KNN query, the user can totally remove this parameter from their constructors. If he needs Spatial Join Query or Distance Join Query but he knows his dataset boundary and approximate total count, the user can also remove StorageLevel parameter and append a Envelope type dataset boundary and an approxmiate total count as additional parameters. If he needs Spatial Join Query or Distance Join Query but knows nothing about his dataset , the user still has to pass StorageLevel parameter. Bug fix : Fix bug Issue #97 and Issue #100 .","title":"v0.8.0 (GeoSpark-core)"},{"location":"archive/download/GeoSpark-All-Modules-Release-notes/#v01-v07","text":"Version Summary 0.7.0 Coordinate Reference System (CRS) Transformation (aka. Coordinate projection) added: GeoSpark allows users to transform the original CRS (e.g., degree based coordinates such as EPSG:4326 and WGS84) to any other CRS (e.g., meter based coordinates such as EPSG:3857) so that it can accurately process both geographic data and geometrical data. Please specify your desired CRS in GeoSpark Spatial RDD constructor ( Example ); Unnecessary dependencies removed : NetCDF/HDF support depends on SerNetCDF . SetNetCDF becomes optional dependency to reduce fat jar size; Default JDK/JRE change to JDK/JRE 1.8 : To satisfy CRS transformation requirement, GeoSpark is compiled by JDK 1.8 by default; Bug fix : fix a small format bug when output spatial RDD to disk. 0.6.2 New input format added: Add a new input format mapper called EarthdataHDFPointMapper so that GeoSpark can load, query and save NASA Petabytes NetCDF/HDF Earth Data ( Scala Example , Java Example ); Bug fix: Print UserData attribute when output Spatial RDDs as GeoJSON or regular text file 0.6.1 Bug fixes: Fix typos LineString DistanceJoin API 0.6.0 Major updates: (1) DistanceJoin is merged into JoinQuery. GeoSpark now supports complete DistanceJoin between Points, Polygons, and LineStrings. (2) Add Refine Phase to Spatial Range and Join Query. Use real polygon coordinates instead of its MBR to filter the final results. API changes: All spatial range and join queries now take a parameter called ConsiderBoundaryIntersection . This will tell GeoSpark whether returns the objects intersect with windows. 0.5.3 Bug fix: Fix Issue #69 : Now, if two objects have the same coordinates but different non-spatial attributes (UserData), GeoSpark treats them as different objects. 0.5.2 Bug fix: Fix Issue #58 and Issue #60 ; Performance enhancement: (1) Deprecate all old Spatial RDD constructors. See the JavaDoc here . (2) Recommend the new SRDD constructors which take an additional RDD storage level and automatically cache rawSpatialRDD to accelerate internal SRDD analyze step 0.5.1 Bug fix: (1) GeoSpark: Fix inaccurate KNN result when K is large (2) GeoSpark: Replace incompatible Spark API call Issue #55 ; (3) Babylon: Remove JPG output format temporarily due to the lack of OpenJDK support 0.5.0 Major updates: We are pleased to announce the initial version of Babylon a large-scale in-memory geospatial visualization system extending GeoSpark. Babylon and GeoSpark are integrated together. You can just import GeoSpark and enjoy! More details are available here: Babylon GeoSpatial Visualization 0.4.0 Major updates: ( Example ) 1. Refactor constrcutor API usage. 2. Simplify Spatial Join Query API. 3. Add native support for LineStringRDD; Functionality enhancement: 1. Release the persist function back to users. 2. Add more exception explanations. 0.3.2 Functionality enhancement: 1. JTSplus Spatial Objects now carry the original input data. Each object stores \"UserData\" and provides getter and setter. 2. Add a new SpatialRDD constructor to transform a regular data RDD to a spatial partitioned SpatialRDD. 0.3.1 Bug fix: Support Apache Spark 2.X version, fix a bug which results in inaccurate results when doing join query, add more unit test cases 0.3 Major updates: Significantly shorten query time on spatial join for skewed data; Support load balanced spatial partitioning methods (also serve as the global index); Optimize code for iterative spatial data mining 0.2 Improve code structure and refactor API 0.1 Support spatial range, join and Knn","title":"v0.1 - v0.7"},{"location":"archive/download/GeoSpark-All-Modules-Release-notes/#geospark-viz-old","text":"Version Summary 0.2.2 Add the support of new output storage : Now the user is able to output gigapixel or megapixel resolution images (image tiles or stitched single image) to HDFS and Amazon S3.

Pick a proper GeoSpark version \u00b6 The versions of GeoSpark have three levels: X.X.X (i.e., 0.8.1). In addition, GeoSpark also supports Spark 1.X in Spark1.X version. The first level means that this verion contains big structure redesign which may bring big changes in APIs and performance. Hopefully, we can see these big changes in GeoSpark 1.X version. The second level (i.e., 0.8) indicates that this version contains significant performance enhancement, big new features and API changes. An old GeoSpark user who wants to pick this version needs to be careful about the API changes. Before you move to this version, please read GeoSpark version release notes and make sure you are ready to accept the API changes. The third level (i.e., 0.8.1) tells that this version only contains bug fixes, some small new features and slight performance enhancement. This version will not contain any API changes. Moving to this version is safe. We highly suggest all GeoSpark users that stay at the same level move to the latest version in this level. Choose a proper Spatial RDD constructor \u00b6 GeoSpark provides a number of constructors for each SpatialRDD (PointRDD, PolygonRDD and LineStringRDD). In general, you have two options to start with. Initialize a SpatialRDD from your data source such as HDFS and S3. A typical example is as follows: public PointRDD ( JavaSparkContext sparkContext , String InputLocation , Integer Offset , FileDataSplitter splitter , boolean carryInputData , Integer partitions , StorageLevel newLevel ) Initialize a SpatialRDD from an existing RDD. A typical example is as follows: public PointRDD ( JavaRDD < Point > rawSpatialRDD , StorageLevel newLevel ) You may notice that these constructors all take as input a \"StorageLevel\" parameter. This is to tell Apache Spark cache the \"rawSpatialRDD\", one attribute of SpatialRDD. The reason why GeoSpark does this is that GeoSpark wants to calculate the dataset boundary and approximate total count using several Apache Spark \"Action\"s. These information are useful when doing Spatial Join Query and Distance Join Query. However, in some cases, you may know well about your datasets. If so, you can manually provide these information by calling this kind of Spatial RDD constructors: public PointRDD ( JavaSparkContext sparkContext , String InputLocation , Integer Offset , FileDataSplitter splitter , boolean carryInputData , Integer partitions , Envelope datasetBoundary , Integer approximateTotalCount ) { Manually providing the dataset boundary and approxmiate total count helps GeoSpark avoiding several slow \"Action\"s during initialization. Cache the Spatial RDD that is repeatedly used \u00b6 Each SpatialRDD (PointRDD, PolygonRDD and LineStringRDD) possesses four RDD attributes. They are: rawSpatialRDD: The RDD generated by SpatialRDD constructors. spatialPartitionedRDD: The RDD generated by spatial partition a rawSpatialRDD. Note that: this RDD has replicated spatial objects. indexedRawRDD: The RDD generated by indexing a rawSpatialRDD. indexedRDD: The RDD generated by indexing a spatialPartitionedRDD. Note that: this RDD has replicated spatial objects. These four RDDs don't co-exist so you don't need to worry about the memory issue. These four RDDs are invoked in different queries: Spatial Range Query / KNN Query, no index: rawSpatialRDD is used. Spatial Range Query / KNN Query, use index: indexedRawRDD is used.

Hopefully, we can see these big changes in GeoSpark 1.X version. The second level (i.e., 0.8) indicates that this version contains significant performance enhancement, big new features and API changes. An old GeoSpark user who wants to pick this version needs to be careful about the API changes. Before you move to this version, please read GeoSpark version release notes and make sure you are ready to accept the API changes. The third level (i.e., 0.8.1) tells that this version only contains bug fixes, some small new features and slight performance enhancement. This version will not contain any API changes.

In general, you have two options to start with. Initialize a SpatialRDD from your data source such as HDFS and S3. A typical example is as follows: public PointRDD ( JavaSparkContext sparkContext , String InputLocation , Integer Offset , FileDataSplitter splitter , boolean carryInputData , Integer partitions , StorageLevel newLevel ) Initialize a SpatialRDD from an existing RDD. A typical example is as follows: public PointRDD ( JavaRDD < Point > rawSpatialRDD , StorageLevel newLevel ) You may notice that these constructors all take as input a \"StorageLevel\" parameter. This is to tell Apache Spark cache the \"rawSpatialRDD\", one attribute of SpatialRDD. The reason why GeoSpark does this is that GeoSpark wants to calculate the dataset boundary and approximate total count using several Apache Spark \"Action\"s. These information are useful when doing Spatial Join Query and Distance Join Query. However, in some cases, you may know well about your datasets. If so, you can manually provide these information by calling this kind of Spatial RDD constructors: public PointRDD ( JavaSparkContext sparkContext , String InputLocation , Integer Offset , FileDataSplitter splitter , boolean carryInputData , Integer partitions , Envelope datasetBoundary , Integer approximateTotalCount ) { Manually providing the dataset boundary and approxmiate total count helps GeoSpark avoiding several slow \"Action\"s during initialization.","title":"Choose a proper Spatial RDD constructor"},{"location":"archive/tutorial/Advanced-Tutorial-Tune-your-GeoSpark-Application/#cache-the-spatial-rdd-that-is-repeatedly-used","text":"Each SpatialRDD (PointRDD, PolygonRDD and LineStringRDD) possesses four RDD attributes.

GeoSpark SpatialRDDs (and other classes when it was necessary) have implemented meta classes which allow to use overloaded functions, methods and constructors to be the most similar to Java/Scala API as possible. GeoSpark-core provides five special SpatialRDDs: PointRDD PolygonRDD LineStringRDD CircleRDD RectangleRDD All of them can be imported from geospark.core.SpatialRDD module geospark has written serializers which convert GeoSpark SpatialRDD to Python objects. Converting will produce GeoData objects which have 2 attributes: geom: shapely.geometry.BaseGeometry userData: str geom attribute holds geometry representation as shapely objects. userData is string representation of other attributes separated by \"\\t\" GeoData has one method to get user data. getUserData() -> str Installing the package \u00b6 GeoSpark extends pyspark functions which depend on Python packages and Scala libraries. To see all dependencies please look at the dependencies section. https://pypi.org/project/pyspark/ . This package needs 2 jar files to work properly: geospark.jar geo_wrapper.jar Note To enable GeoSpark Core functionality without GeoSparkSQL there is no need to copy jar files from geospark/jars location. You can use jar files from Maven repositories. Since GeoSpark 1.3.0 it is possible also to use maven jars for GeoSparkSQL instead of geospark/jars/../geospark-sql jars files. This package automatically copies the newest GeoSpark jar files using upload_jars function, please follow the example below. upload_jars from pyspark.sql import SparkSession from geospark.register import upload_jars from geospark.register import GeoSparkRegistrator upload_jars () spark = SparkSession . builder . \\ getOrCreate () GeoSparkRegistrator . registerAll ( spark ) Function upload_jars () uses findspark Python package to upload jar files to executor and nodes. To avoid copying all the time, jar files can be put in directory SPARK_HOME/jars or any other path specified in Spark config files. Installing from PyPi repositories \u00b6 Please use command below pip install geospark Installing from wheel file \u00b6 pipenv run python -m pip install dist/geospark-1.3.1-py3-none-any.whl or pip install dist/geospark-1.3.1-py3-none-any.whl Installing from source \u00b6 python3 setup.py install GeoSpark Serializers \u00b6 GeoSpark has a suite of well-written geometry and index serializers. Forgetting to enable these serializers will lead to high memory consumption. conf . set ( \"spark.serializer\" , KryoSerializer . getName ) conf . set ( \"spark.kryo.registrator\" , GeoSparkKryoRegistrator . getName ) Create a SpatialRDD \u00b6 Create a typed SpatialRDD \u00b6 GeoSpark-core provides three special SpatialRDDs: PointRDD PolygonRDD LineStringRDD CircleRDD RectangleRDD They can be loaded from CSV, TSV, WKT, WKB, Shapefiles, GeoJSON formats. To pass the format to SpatialRDD constructor please use FileDataSplitter enumeration. geospark SpatialRDDs (and other classes when it was necessary) have implemented meta classes which allow to use overloaded functions how Scala/Java GeoSpark API allows. ex. from pyspark import StorageLevel from geospark.core.SpatialRDD import PointRDD from geospark.core.enums import FileDataSplitter input_location = \"checkin.csv\" offset = 0 # The point long/lat starts from Column 0 splitter = FileDataSplitter . CSV # FileDataSplitter enumeration carry_other_attributes = True # Carry Column 2 (hotel, gas, bar...) level = StorageLevel .

Read other attributes in an SpatialRDD \u00b6 Each SpatialRDD can carry non-spatial attributes such as price, age and name as long as the user sets carryOtherAttributes as TRUE . The other attributes are combined together to a string and stored in UserData field of each geometry. To retrieve the UserData field, use the following code: rdd_with_other_attributes = object_rdd . rawSpatialRDD . map ( lambda x : x . getUserData ()) Write a Spatial Range Query \u00b6 from geospark.core.geom.envelope import Envelope from geospark.core.spatialOperator import RangeQuery range_query_window = Envelope ( - 90.01 , - 80.01 , 30.01 , 40.01 ) consider_boundary_intersection = False ## Only return gemeotries fully covered by the window using_index = False query_result = RangeQuery . SpatialRangeQuery ( spatial_rdd , range_query_window , consider_boundary_intersection , using_index ) Range query window \u00b6 Besides the rectangle (Envelope) type range query window, GeoSpark range query window can be Point Polygon LineString The code to create a point is as follows: To create shapely geometries please follow official shapely documentation Use spatial indexes \u00b6 GeoSpark provides two types of spatial indexes, Quad-Tree R-Tree Once you specify an index type, GeoSpark will build a local tree index on each of the SpatialRDD partition. To utilize a spatial index in a spatial range query, use the following code: from geospark.core.geom.envelope import Envelope from geospark.core.enums import IndexType from geospark.core.spatialOperator import RangeQuery range_query_window = Envelope ( - 90.01 , - 80.01 , 30.01 , 40.01 ) consider_boundary_intersection = False ## Only return gemeotries fully covered by the window build_on_spatial_partitioned_rdd = False ## Set to TRUE only if run join query spatial_rdd . buildIndex ( IndexType . QUADTREE , build_on_spatial_partitioned_rdd ) using_index = True query_result = RangeQuery . SpatialRangeQuery ( spatial_rdd , range_query_window , consider_boundary_intersection , using_index ) Output format \u00b6 The output format of the spatial range query is another RDD which consists of GeoData objects. SpatialRangeQuery result can be used as RDD with map or other spark RDD funtions. Also it can be used as Python objects when using collect method. Example: query_result . map ( lambda x : x . geom . length ) . collect () [ 1.5900840000000045, 1.5906639999999896, 1.1110299999999995, 1.1096700000000084, 1.1415619999999933, 1.1386399999999952, 1.1415619999999933, 1.1418860000000137, 1.1392780000000045, ... ] Or transformed to GeoPandas GeoDataFrame import geopandas as gpd gpd . GeoDataFrame ( query_result . map ( lambda x : [ x . geom , x . userData ]) . collect (), columns = [ \"geom\" , \"user_data\" ], geometry = \"geom\" ) Write a Spatial KNN Query \u00b6 A spatial K Nearnest Neighbor query takes as input a K, a query point and an SpatialRDD and finds the K geometries in the RDD which are the closest to he query point. Assume you now have an SpatialRDD (typed or generic). You can use the following code to issue an Spatial KNN Query on it. from geospark.core.spatialOperator import KNNQuery from shapely.geometry import Point point = Point ( - 84.01 , 34.01 ) k = 1000 ## K Nearest Neighbors using_index = False result = KNNQuery . SpatialKnnQuery ( object_rdd , point , k , using_index ) Query center geometry \u00b6 Besides the Point type, GeoSpark KNN query center can be Polygon LineString To create Polygon or Linestring object please follow Shapely official documentation Use spatial indexes \u00b6 To utilize a spatial index in a spatial KNN query, use the following code: from geospark.core.spatialOperator import KNNQuery from geospark.core.enums import IndexType from shapely.geometry import Point point = Point ( - 84.01 , 34.01 ) k = 5 ## K Nearest Neighbors build_on_spatial_partitioned_rdd = False ## Set to TRUE only if run join query spatial_rdd . buildIndex ( IndexType . RTREE , build_on_spatial_partitioned_rdd ) using_index = True result = KNNQuery . SpatialKnnQuery ( spatial_rdd , point , k , using_index ) Warning Only R-Tree index supports Spatial KNN query Output format \u00b6 The output format of the spatial KNN query is a list of GeoData objects. The list has K GeoData objects. Example: >> result [ GeoData , GeoData , GeoData , GeoData , GeoData ] Write a Spatial Join Query \u00b6 A spatial join query takes as input two Spatial RDD A and B. For each geometry in A, finds the geometries (from B) covered/intersected by it. A and B can be any geometry type and are not necessary to have the same geometry type. Assume you now have two SpatialRDDs (typed or generic). You can use the following code to issue an Spatial Join Query on them. from geospark.core.enums import GridType from geospark.core.spatialOperator import JoinQuery consider_boundary_intersection = False ## Only return geometries fully covered by each query window in queryWindowRDD using_index = False object_rdd . analyze () object_rdd . spatialPartitioning ( GridType . KDBTREE ) query_window_rdd . spatialPartitioning ( object_rdd . getPartitioner ()) result = JoinQuery . SpatialJoinQuery ( object_rdd , query_window_rdd , using_index , consider_boundary_intersection ) Result of SpatialJoinQuery is RDD which consists of GeoData instance and list of GeoData instances which spatially intersects or are covered by GeoData. result . collect ()) [ [GeoData, [GeoData, GeoData, GeoData, GeoData]], [GeoData, [GeoData, GeoData, GeoData]], [GeoData, [GeoData]], [GeoData, [GeoData, GeoData]], ... [GeoData, [GeoData, GeoData]] ] Use spatial partitioning \u00b6 GeoSpark spatial partitioning method can significantly speed up the join query. Three spatial partitioning methods are available: KDB-Tree, Quad-Tree and R-Tree. Two SpatialRDD must be partitioned by the same way. If you first partition SpatialRDD A, then you must use the partitioner of A to partition B. object_rdd . spatialPartitioning ( GridType . KDBTREE ) query_window_rdd . spatialPartitioning ( object_rdd . getPartitioner ()) Or query_window_rdd . spatialPartitioning ( GridType . KDBTREE ) object_rdd . spatialPartitioning ( query_window_rdd . getPartitioner ()) Use spatial indexes \u00b6 To utilize a spatial index in a spatial join query, use the following code: from geospark.core.enums import GridType from geospark.core.enums import IndexType from geospark.core.spatialOperator import JoinQuery object_rdd . spatialPartitioning ( GridType . KDBTREE ) query_window_rdd . spatialPartitioning ( object_rdd . getPartitioner ()) build_on_spatial_partitioned_rdd = True ## Set to TRUE only if run join query using_index = True query_window_rdd . buildIndex ( IndexType . QUADTREE , build_on_spatial_partitioned_rdd ) result = JoinQuery . SpatialJoinQueryFlat ( object_rdd , query_window_rdd , using_index , True ) The index should be built on either one of two SpatialRDDs. In general, you should build it on the larger SpatialRDD. Output format \u00b6 The output format of the spatial join query is a PairRDD. In this PairRDD, each object is a pair of two GeoData objects. The left one is the GeoData from object_rdd and the right one is the GeoData from the query_window_rdd. Point,Polygon Point,Polygon Point,Polygon Polygon,Polygon LineString,LineString Polygon,LineString ... example result . collect () [ [GeoData, GeoData], [GeoData, GeoData], [GeoData, GeoData], [GeoData, GeoData], ... [GeoData, GeoData], [GeoData, GeoData] ] Each object on the left is covered/intersected by the object on the right. Write a Distance Join Query \u00b6 A distance join query takes two spatial RDD assuming that we have two SpatialRDD's: object_rdd spatial_rdd And finds the geometries (from spatial_rdd) are within given distance to it. spatial_rdd and object_rdd can be any geometry type (point, line, polygon) and are not necessary to have the same geometry type You can use the following code to issue an Distance Join Query on them. from geospark.core.SpatialRDD import CircleRDD from geospark.core.enums import GridType from geospark.core.spatialOperator import JoinQuery object_rdd . analyze () circle_rdd = CircleRDD ( object_rdd , 0.1 ) ## Create a CircleRDD using the given distance circle_rdd . analyze () circle_rdd . spatialPartitioning ( GridType . KDBTREE ) spatial_rdd . spatialPartitioning ( circle_rdd . getPartitioner ()) consider_boundary_intersection = False ## Only return gemeotries fully covered by each query window in queryWindowRDD using_index = False result = JoinQuery . DistanceJoinQueryFlat ( spatial_rdd , circle_rdd , using_index , consider_boundary_intersection ) Output format \u00b6 Result for this query is RDD which holds two GeoData objects within list of lists. Example: result . collect () [[GeoData, GeoData], [GeoData, GeoData] ...] It is possible to do some RDD operation on result data ex. Getting polygon centroid. result . map ( lambda x : x [ 0 ] . geom . centroid ) . collect () [ <shapely.geometry.point.Point at 0x7efee2d28128>, <shapely.geometry.point.Point at 0x7efee2d280b8>, <shapely.geometry.point.Point at 0x7efee2d28fd0>, <shapely.geometry.point.Point at 0x7efee2d28080>, ... ] Save to permanent storage \u00b6 You can always save an SpatialRDD back to some permanent storage such as HDFS and Amazon S3. You can save distributed SpatialRDD to WKT, GeoJSON and object files. Note Non-spatial attributes such as price, age and name will also be stored to permanent storage. Save an SpatialRDD (not indexed) \u00b6 Typed SpatialRDD and generic SpatialRDD can be saved to permanent storage. Save to distributed WKT text file \u00b6 Use the following code to save an SpatialRDD as a distributed WKT text file: object_rdd . rawSpatialRDD . saveAsTextFile ( \"hdfs://PATH\" ) object_rdd . saveAsWKT ( \"hdfs://PATH\" ) Save to distributed WKB text file \u00b6 Use the following code to save an SpatialRDD as a distributed WKB text file: object_rdd . saveAsWKB ( \"hdfs://PATH\" ) Save to distributed GeoJSON text file \u00b6 Use the following code to save an SpatialRDD as a distributed GeoJSON text file: object_rdd . saveAsGeoJSON ( \"hdfs://PATH\" ) Save to distributed object file \u00b6 Use the following code to save an SpatialRDD as a distributed object file: object_rdd . rawJvmSpatialRDD . saveAsObjectFile ( \"hdfs://PATH\" ) Note Each object in a distributed object file is a byte array (not human-readable). This byte array is the serialized format of a Geometry or a SpatialIndex. Save an SpatialRDD (indexed) \u00b6 Indexed typed SpatialRDD and generic SpatialRDD can be saved to permanent storage. However, the indexed SpatialRDD has to be stored as a distributed object file. Save to distributed object file \u00b6 Use the following code to save an SpatialRDD as a distributed object file: object_rdd . indexedRawRDD . saveAsObjectFile ( \"hdfs://PATH\" ) Save an SpatialRDD (spatialPartitioned W/O indexed) \u00b6 A spatial partitioned RDD can be saved to permanent storage but Spark is not able to maintain the same RDD partition Id of the original RDD. This will lead to wrong join query results. We are working on some solutions. Stay tuned! Reload a saved SpatialRDD \u00b6 You can easily reload an SpatialRDD that has been saved to a distributed object file . Load to a typed SpatialRDD \u00b6 Use the following code to reload the PointRDD/PolygonRDD/LineStringRDD: from geospark.core.formatMapper.disc_utils import load_spatial_rdd_from_disc , GeoType polygon_rdd = load_spatial_rdd_from_disc ( sc , \"hdfs://PATH\" , GeoType .

The official repository for GeoSpark can be found at https://github.com/DataSystemsLab/GeoSpark . This package allows users to use all GeoSparkSQL functions and transform it to Python Shapely geometry objects. Also it allows to create Spark DataFrame with GeoSpark UDT from Shapely geometry objects. Spark DataFrame can be converted to GeoPandas easily, in addition all fiona drivers for shape file are available to load data from files and convert them to Spark DataFrame. Please look at examples. Installation \u00b6 GeoSpark extends pyspark functions which depends on Python packages and Scala libraries. To see all dependencies please look at Dependencies section. https://pypi.org/project/pyspark/ . Package needs 2 jar files to work properly: geospark.jar geospark-sql.jar geo_wrapper.jar Note Since GeoSpark 1.3.0 it is possible also to use maven jars for GeoSparkSQL instead of geospark/jars/../geospark-sql jars files. This package automatically copies the newest GeoSpark jar files using function, please follow the example below. upload_jars from pyspark.sql import SparkSession from geospark.register import upload_jars from geospark.register import GeoSparkRegistrator upload_jars () spark = SparkSession . builder . \\ getOrCreate () GeoSparkRegistrator . registerAll ( spark ) Function upload_jars () uses findspark Python package to upload jar files to executor and nodes. To avoid copying all the time, jar files can be put in directory SPARK_HOME/jars or any other path specified in Spark config files. Installing from PyPi repositories \u00b6 Please use command below pip install geospark Installing from wheel file \u00b6 pipenv run python -m pip install dist/geospark-1.3.1-py3-none-any.whl or pip install dist/geospark-1.3.1-py3-none-any.whl Installing from source \u00b6 python3 setup.py install Core Classes and methods. \u00b6 GeoSparkRegistrator.registerAll(spark: pyspark.sql.SparkSession) -> bool This is the core of whole package. Class method registers all GeoSparkSQL functions (available for used GeoSparkSQL version). To check available functions please look at GeoSparkSQL section. :param spark: pyspark.sql.SparkSession, spark session instance upload_jars() -> NoReturn Function uses findspark Python module to upload newest GeoSpark jars to Spark executor and nodes. GeometryType() Class which handle serialization and deserialization between GeoSpark geometries and Shapely BaseGeometry types. KryoSerializer.getName -> str Class property which returns org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoSerializer string, which simplify using GeoSpark Serializers. GeoSparkKryoRegistrator.getName -> str Class property which returns org.datasyslab.geospark.serde.GeoSparkKryoRegistrator string, which simplify using GeoSpark Serializers. Writing Application \u00b6 Use KryoSerializer.getName and GeoSparkKryoRegistrator.getName class properties to reduce memory impact, reffering to GeoSpark docs . To do that use spark config as follows: . config ( \"spark.serializer\" , KryoSerializer . getName ) . config ( \"spark.kryo.registrator\" , GeoSparkKryoRegistrator . getName ) If jars was not uploaded manually please use function upload_jars() To turn on GeoSparkSQL function inside pyspark code use GeoSparkRegistrator.registerAll method on existing pyspark.sql.SparkSession instance ex. GeoSparkRegistrator.registerAll(spark) After that all the functions from GeoSparkSQL will be available, moreover using collect or toPandas methods on Spark DataFrame will return Shapely BaseGeometry objects. Based on GeoPandas DataFrame, Pandas DataFrame with shapely objects or Sequence with shapely objects, Spark DataFrame can be created using spark.createDataFrame method. To specify Schema with geometry inside please use GeometryType() instance (look at examples section to see that in practice). Examples \u00b6 GeoSparkSQL \u00b6 All GeoSparkSQL functions (list depends on GeoSparkSQL version) are available in Python API.

Add the dependencies in build.sbt or pom.xml. Note To enjoy the full functions of GeoSpark, we suggest you include the full dependencies : Apache Spark core , Apache SparkSQL , GeoSpark core , GeoSparkSQL , GeoSparkViz Initiate SparkContext \u00b6 val conf = new SparkConf () conf . setAppName ( \"GeoSparkRunnableExample\" ) // Change this to a proper name conf . setMaster ( \"local[*]\" ) // Delete this if run in cluster mode // Enable GeoSpark custom Kryo serializer conf . set ( \"spark.serializer\" , classOf [ KryoSerializer ]. getName ) conf . set ( \"spark.kryo.registrator\" , classOf [ GeoSparkKryoRegistrator ]. getName ) val sc = new SparkContext ( conf ) Warning GeoSpark has a suite of well-written geometry and index serializers.

If you add the GeoSpark full dependencies as suggested above, please use the following two lines to enable GeoSpark Kryo serializer instead: conf . set ( \"spark.serializer\" , classOf [ KryoSerializer ]. getName ) conf . set ( \"spark.kryo.registrator\" , classOf [ GeoSparkVizKryoRegistrator ]. getName ) Create a SpatialRDD \u00b6 Create a typed SpatialRDD \u00b6 GeoSpark-core provides three special SpatialRDDs: PointRDD, PolygonRDD, and LineStringRDD . They can be loaded from CSV, TSV, WKT, WKB, Shapefiles, GeoJSON and NetCDF/HDF format. PointRDD from CSV/TSV \u00b6 Suppose we have a checkin.csv CSV file at Path /Download/checkin.csv as follows: -88.331492,32.324142,hotel -88.175933,32.360763,gas -88.388954,32.357073,bar -88.221102,32.35078,restaurant This file has three columns and corresponding offsets (Column IDs) are 0, 1, 2. Use the following code to create a PointRDD val pointRDDInputLocation = \"/Download/checkin.csv\" val pointRDDOffset = 0 // The point long/lat starts from Column 0 val pointRDDSplitter = FileDataSplitter . CSV val carryOtherAttributes = true // Carry Column 2 (hotel, gas, bar...) var objectRDD = new PointRDD ( sc , pointRDDInputLocation , pointRDDOffset , pointRDDSplitter , carryOtherAttributes ) If the data file is in TSV format, just simply use the following line to replace the old FileDataSplitter: val pointRDDSplitter = FileDataSplitter . TSV PolygonRDD/LineStringRDD from CSV/TSV \u00b6 In general, polygon and line string data is stored in WKT, WKB, GeoJSON and Shapefile formats instead of CSV/TSV because the geometries in a file may have different lengths. However, if all polygons / line strings in your CSV/TSV possess the same length, you can create PolygonRDD and LineStringRDD from these files. Suppose we have a checkinshape.csv CSV file at Path /Download/checkinshape.csv as follows: -88.331492,32.324142,-88.331492,32.324142,-88.331492,32.324142,-88.331492,32.324142,-88.331492,32.324142,hotel -88.175933,32.360763,-88.175933,32.360763,-88.175933,32.360763,-88.175933,32.360763,-88.175933,32.360763,gas -88.388954,32.357073,-88.388954,32.357073,-88.388954,32.357073,-88.388954,32.357073,-88.388954,32.357073,bar -88.221102,32.35078,-88.221102,32.35078,-88.221102,32.35078,-88.221102,32.35078,-88.221102,32.35078,restaurant This file has 11 columns and corresponding offsets (Column IDs) are 0 - 10. Column 0 - 9 are 5 coordinates (longitude/latitude pairs). In this file, all geometries have the same number of coordinates. The geometries can be polyons or line strings. Warning For polygon data, the last coordinate must be the same as the first coordinate because a polygon is a closed linear ring. Use the following code to create a PolygonRDD. val polygonRDDInputLocation = \"/Download/checkinshape.csv\" val polygonRDDStartOffset = 0 // The coordinates start from Column 0 val polygonRDDEndOffset = 9 // The coordinates end at Column 9 val polygonRDDSplitter = FileDataSplitter . CSV val carryOtherAttributes = true // Carry Column 10 (hotel, gas, bar...) var objectRDD = new PolygonRDD ( sc , polygonRDDInputLocation , polygonRDDStartOffset , polygonRDDEndOffset , polygonRDDSplitter , carryOtherAttributes ) If the data file is in TSV format, just simply use the following line to replace the old FileDataSplitter: val polygonRDDSplitter = FileDataSplitter . TSV The way to create a LineStringRDD is the same as PolygonRDD. Create a generic SpatialRDD (behavoir changed in v1.2.0) \u00b6 A generic SpatialRDD is not typed to a certain geometry type and open to more scenarios. It allows an input data file contains mixed types of geometries. For instance, a WKT file contains three types gemetries LineString , Polygon and MultiPolygon . From WKT/WKB \u00b6 Geometries in a WKT and WKB file always occupy a single column no matter how many coordinates they have. Therefore, creating a typed SpatialRDD is easy. Suppose we have a checkin.tsv WKT TSV file at Path /Download/checkin.tsv as follows: POINT (-88.331492 32.324142) hotel POINT (-88.175933 32.360763) gas POINT (-88.388954 32.357073) bar POINT (-88.221102 32.35078) restaurant This file has two columns and corresponding offsets (Column IDs) are 0, 1. Column 0 is the WKT string and Column 1 is the checkin business type.

Assume you have a shape file called myShapefile , the file structure should be like this: - shapefile1 - shapefile2 - myshapefile - myshapefile.shp - myshapefile.shx - myshapefile.dbf - myshapefile... - ... If the file you are reading contains non-ASCII characters you'll need to explicitly set the encoding via geospark.global.charset system property before the call to ShapefileReader.readToGeometryRDD . Example: System . setProperty ( \"geospark.global.charset\" , \"utf8\" ) From SparkSQL DataFrame \u00b6 To create a generic SpatialRDD from CSV, TSV, WKT, WKB and GeoJSON input formats, you can use GeoSparkSQL. Make sure you include the full dependencies of GeoSpark. Read GeoSparkSQL API . We use checkin.csv CSV file as the example. You can create a generic SpatialRDD using the following steps: Load data in GeoSparkSQL. var df = sparkSession . read . format ( \"csv\" ). option ( \"header\" , \"false\" ). load ( csvPointInputLocation ) df . createOrReplaceTempView ( \"inputtable\" ) Create a Geometry type column in GeoSparkSQL var spatialDf = sparkSession . sql ( \"\"\" |SELECT ST_Point(CAST(inputtable._c0 AS Decimal(24,20)),CAST(inputtable._c1 AS Decimal(24,20))) AS checkin |FROM inputtable \"\"\" . stripMargin ) Use GeoSparkSQL DataFrame-RDD Adapter to convert a DataFrame to an SpatialRDD var spatialRDD = new SpatialRDD [ Geometry ] spatialRDD . rawSpatialRDD = Adapter . toRdd ( spatialDf ) For WKT/WKB/GeoJSON data, please use ST_GeomFromWKT / ST_GeomFromWKB / ST_GeomFromGeoJSON instead. Transform the Coordinate Reference System \u00b6 GeoSpark doesn't control the coordinate unit (degree-based or meter-based) of all geometries in an SpatialRDD. The unit of all related distances in GeoSpark is same as the unit of all geometries in an SpatialRDD. To convert Coordinate Reference System of an SpatialRDD, use the following code: val sourceCrsCode = \"epsg:4326\" // WGS84, the most common degree-based CRS val targetCrsCode = \"epsg:3857\" // The most common meter-based CRS objectRDD . CRSTransform ( sourceCrsCode , targetCrsCode ) Warning CRS transformation should be done right after creating each SpatialRDD, otherwise it will lead to wrong query results. For instace, use something like this: var objectRDD = new PointRDD ( sc , pointRDDInputLocation , pointRDDOffset , pointRDDSplitter , carryOtherAttributes ) objectRDD . CRSTransform ( \"epsg:4326\" , \"epsg:3857\" ) The details CRS information can be found on EPSG.io Read other attributes in an SpatialRDD \u00b6 Each SpatialRDD can carry non-spatial attributes such as price, age and name as long as the user sets carryOtherAttributes as TRUE . The other attributes are combined together to a string and stored in UserData field of each geometry. To retrieve the UserData field, use the following code: val rddWithOtherAttributes = objectRDD . rawSpatialRDD . rdd . map [ String ]( f => f . getUserData . asInstanceOf [ String ]) Write a Spatial Range Query \u00b6 A spatial range query takes as input a range query window and an SpatialRDD and returns all geometries that intersect / are fully covered by the query window. Assume you now have an SpatialRDD (typed or generic). You can use the following code to issue an Spatial Range Query on it. val rangeQueryWindow = new Envelope (- 90.01 , - 80.01 , 30.01 , 40.01 ) val considerBoundaryIntersection = false // Only return gemeotries fully covered by the window val usingIndex = false var queryResult = RangeQuery . SpatialRangeQuery ( spatialRDD , rangeQueryWindow , considerBoundaryIntersection , usingIndex ) considerBoundaryIntersection can be set to TRUE to return all geometries intersect with query window. Note Spatial range query is equal to ST_Within and ST_Intersects in Spatial SQL. An example query is as follows: SELECT * FROM checkin WHERE ST_Intersects ( queryWindow , checkin . location ) Range query window \u00b6 Besides the rectangle (Envelope) type range query window, GeoSpark range query window can be Point/Polygon/LineString. The code to create a point is as follows: val geometryFactory = new GeometryFactory () val pointObject = geometryFactory . createPoint ( new Coordinate (- 84.01 , 34.01 )) The code to create a polygon (with 4 vertexes) is as follows: val geometryFactory = new GeometryFactory () val coordinates = new Array [ Coordinate ]( 5 ) coordinates ( 0 ) = new Coordinate ( 0 , 0 ) coordinates ( 1 ) = new Coordinate ( 0 , 4 ) coordinates ( 2 ) = new Coordinate ( 4 , 4 ) coordinates ( 3 ) = new Coordinate ( 4 , 0 ) coordinates ( 4 ) = coordinates ( 0 ) // The last coordinate is the same as the first coordinate in order to compose a closed ring val polygonObject = geometryFactory . createPolygon ( coordinates ) The code to create a line string (with 4 vertexes) is as follows: val geometryFactory = new GeometryFactory () val coordinates = new Array [ Coordinate ]( 4 ) coordinates ( 0 ) = new Coordinate ( 0 , 0 ) coordinates ( 1 ) = new Coordinate ( 0 , 4 ) coordinates ( 2 ) = new Coordinate ( 4 , 4 ) coordinates ( 3 ) = new Coordinate ( 4 , 0 ) val linestringObject = geometryFactory . createLineString ( coordinates ) Use spatial indexes \u00b6 GeoSpark provides two types of spatial indexes, Quad-Tree and R-Tree. Once you specify an index type, GeoSpark will build a local tree index on each of the SpatialRDD partition. To utilize a spatial index in a spatial range query, use the following code: val rangeQueryWindow = new Envelope (- 90.01 , - 80.01 , 30.01 , 40.01 ) val considerBoundaryIntersection = false // Only return gemeotries fully covered by the window val buildOnSpatialPartitionedRDD = false // Set to TRUE only if run join query spatialRDD . buildIndex ( IndexType . QUADTREE , buildOnSpatialPartitionedRDD ) val usingIndex = true var queryResult = RangeQuery . SpatialRangeQuery ( spatialRDD , rangeQueryWindow , considerBoundaryIntersection , usingIndex ) Tip Using an index might not be the best choice all the time because building index also takes time. A spatial index is very useful when your data is complex polygons and line strings. Output format \u00b6 The output format of the spatial range query is another SpatialRDD. Write a Spatial KNN Query \u00b6 A spatial K Nearnest Neighbor query takes as input a K, a query point and an SpatialRDD and finds the K geometries in the RDD which are the closest to he query point. Assume you now have an SpatialRDD (typed or generic). You can use the following code to issue an Spatial KNN Query on it. val geometryFactory = new GeometryFactory () val pointObject = geometryFactory . createPoint ( new Coordinate (- 84.01 , 34.01 )) val K = 1000 // K Nearest Neighbors val usingIndex = false val result = KNNQuery . SpatialKnnQuery ( objectRDD , pointObject , K , usingIndex ) Note Spatial KNN query that returns 5 Nearest Neighbors is equal to the following statement in Spatial SQL SELECT ck . name , ck . rating , ST_Distance ( ck . location , myLocation ) AS distance FROM checkins ck ORDER BY distance DESC LIMIT 5 Query center geometry \u00b6 Besides the Point type, GeoSpark KNN query center can be Polygon and LineString. To learn how to create Polygon and LineString object, see Range query window . Use spatial indexes \u00b6 To utilize a spatial index in a spatial KNN query, use the following code: val geometryFactory = new GeometryFactory () val pointObject = geometryFactory . createPoint ( new Coordinate (- 84.01 , 34.01 )) val K = 1000 // K Nearest Neighbors val buildOnSpatialPartitionedRDD = false // Set to TRUE only if run join query objectRDD . buildIndex ( IndexType . RTREE , buildOnSpatialPartitionedRDD ) val usingIndex = true val result = KNNQuery . SpatialKnnQuery ( objectRDD , pointObject , K , usingIndex ) Warning Only R-Tree index supports Spatial KNN query Output format \u00b6 The output format of the spatial KNN query is a list of geometries. The list has K geometry objects. Write a Spatial Join Query \u00b6 A spatial join query takes as input two Spatial RDD A and B. For each geometry in A, finds the geometries (from B) covered/intersected by it. A and B can be any geometry type and are not necessary to have the same geometry type. Assume you now have two SpatialRDDs (typed or generic). You can use the following code to issue an Spatial Join Query on them. val considerBoundaryIntersection = false // Only return gemeotries fully covered by each query window in queryWindowRDD val usingIndex = false objectRDD . analyze () objectRDD . spatialPartitioning ( GridType . KDBTREE ) queryWindowRDD . spatialPartitioning ( objectRDD . getPartitioner ) val result = JoinQuery . SpatialJoinQuery ( objectRDD , queryWindowRDD , usingIndex , considerBoundaryIntersection ) Note Spatial join query is equal to the following query in Spatial SQL: SELECT superhero . name FROM city , superhero WHERE ST_Contains ( city . geom , superhero . geom ); Find the super heros in each city Use spatial partitioning \u00b6 GeoSpark spatial partitioning method can significantly speed up the join query. Three spatial partitioning methods are available: KDB-Tree, Quad-Tree and R-Tree. Two SpatialRDD must be partitioned by the same way. If you first partition SpatialRDD A, then you must use the partitioner of A to partition B. objectRDD . spatialPartitioning ( GridType . KDBTREE ) queryWindowRDD . spatialPartitioning ( objectRDD . getPartitioner ) Or queryWindowRDD . spatialPartitioning ( GridType . KDBTREE ) objectRDD . spatialPartitioning ( queryWindowRDD . getPartitioner ) Use spatial indexes \u00b6 To utilize a spatial index in a spatial join query, use the following code: objectRDD . spatialPartitioning ( joinQueryPartitioningType ) queryWindowRDD . spatialPartitioning ( objectRDD . getPartitioner ) val buildOnSpatialPartitionedRDD = true // Set to TRUE only if run join query val usingIndex = true queryWindowRDD . buildIndex ( IndexType . QUADTREE , buildOnSpatialPartitionedRDD ) val result = JoinQuery . SpatialJoinQueryFlat ( objectRDD , queryWindowRDD , usingIndex , considerBoundaryIntersection ) The index should be built on either one of two SpatialRDDs. In general, you should build it on the larger SpatialRDD. Output format \u00b6 The output format of the spatial join query is a PairRDD. In this PairRDD, each object is a pair of two geometries. The left one is the geometry from objectRDD and the right one is the geometry from the queryWindowRDD. Point,Polygon Point,Polygon Point,Polygon Polygon,Polygon LineString,LineString Polygon,LineString ... Each object on the left is covered/intersected by the object on the right. Write a Distance Join Query \u00b6 A distance join query takes as input two Spatial RDD A and B and a distance. For each geometry in A, finds the geometries (from B) are within the given distance to it. A and B can be any geometry type and are not necessary to have the same geometry type. The unit of the distance is explained here . Assume you now have two SpatialRDDs (typed or generic). You can use the following code to issue an Distance Join Query on them. objectRddA . analyze () val circleRDD = new CircleRDD ( objectRddA , 0.1 ) // Create a CircleRDD using the given distance circleRDD . spatialPartitioning ( GridType . KDBTREE ) objectRddB . spatialPartitioning ( circleRDD . getPartitioner ) val considerBoundaryIntersection = false // Only return gemeotries fully covered by each query window in queryWindowRDD val usingIndex = false val result = JoinQuery . DistanceJoinQueryFlat ( objectRddB , circleRDD , usingIndex , considerBoundaryIntersection ) The rest part of the join query is same as the spatial join query. The details of spatial partitioning in join query is here . The details of using spatial indexes in join query is here . The output format of the distance join query is here . Note Distance join query is equal to the following query in Spatial SQL: SELECT superhero . name FROM city , superhero WHERE ST_Distance ( city . geom , superhero . geom ) <= 10 ; Find the super heros within 10 miles of each city Save to permanent storage \u00b6 You can always save an SpatialRDD back to some permanent storage such as HDFS and Amazon S3. You can save distributed SpatialRDD to WKT, GeoJSON and object files. Note Non-spatial attributes such as price, age and name will also be stored to permanent storage. Save an SpatialRDD (not indexed) \u00b6 Typed SpatialRDD and generic SpatialRDD can be saved to permanent storage. Save to distributed WKT text file \u00b6 Use the following code to save an SpatialRDD as a distributed WKT text file: objectRDD . rawSpatialRDD . saveAsTextFile ( \"hdfs://PATH\" ) objectRDD . saveAsWKT ( \"hdfs://PATH\" ) Save to distributed WKB text file \u00b6 Use the following code to save an SpatialRDD as a distributed WKB text file: objectRDD . saveAsWKB ( \"hdfs://PATH\" ) Save to distributed GeoJSON text file \u00b6 Use the following code to save an SpatialRDD as a distributed GeoJSON text file: objectRDD . saveAsGeoJSON ( \"hdfs://PATH\" ) Save to distributed object file \u00b6 Use the following code to save an SpatialRDD as a distributed object file: objectRDD . rawSpatialRDD . saveAsObjectFile ( \"hdfs://PATH\" ) Note Each object in a distributed object file is a byte array (not human-readable). This byte array is the serialized format of a Geometry or a SpatialIndex. Save an SpatialRDD (indexed) \u00b6 Indexed typed SpatialRDD and generic SpatialRDD can be saved to permanent storage. However, the indexed SpatialRDD has to be stored as a distributed object file. Save to distributed object file \u00b6 Use the following code to save an SpatialRDD as a distributed object file: objectRDD.indexedRawRDD.saveAsObjectFile(\"hdfs://PATH\") Save an SpatialRDD (spatialPartitioned W/O indexed) \u00b6 A spatial partitioned RDD can be saved to permanent storage but Spark is not able to maintain the same RDD partition Id of the original RDD. This will lead to wrong join query results. We are working on some solutions. Stay tuned! Reload a saved SpatialRDD \u00b6 You can easily reload an SpatialRDD that has been saved to a distributed object file . Load to a typed SpatialRDD \u00b6 Use the following code to reload the PointRDD/PolygonRDD/LineStringRDD: var savedRDD = new PointRDD ( sc . objectFile [ Point ]( \"hdfs://PATH\" )) var savedRDD = new PointRDD ( sc . objectFile [ Polygon ]( \"hdfs://PATH\" )) var savedRDD = new PointRDD ( sc . objectFile [ LineString ]( \"hdfs://PATH\" )) Load to a generic SpatialRDD \u00b6 Use the following code to reload the SpatialRDD: var savedRDD = new SpatialRDD [ Geometry ] savedRDD . rawSpatialRDD = sc . objectFile [ Geometry ]( \"hdfs://PATH\" ) Use the following code to reload the indexed SpatialRDD: var savedRDD = new SpatialRDD [ Geometry ] savedRDD . indexedRawRDD = sc . objectFile [ SpatialIndex ]( \"hdfs://PATH\" )","title":"Spatial RDD application"},{"location":"archive/tutorial/rdd/#set-up-dependencies","text":"Read GeoSpark Maven Central coordinates Select the minimum dependencies : Add Apache Spark (only the Spark core) and GeoSpark (core).

Transform the Coordinate Reference System \u00b6 GeoSpark doesn't control the coordinate unit (degree-based or meter-based) of all geometries in a Geometry column. The unit of all related distances in GeoSparkSQL is same as the unit of all geometries in a Geometry column. To convert Coordinate Reference System of the Geometry column created before, use the following code: spatialDf = sparkSession . sql ( \"\"\" |SELECT ST_Transform(countyshape, \"epsg:4326\", \"epsg:3857\") AS newcountyshape, _c1, _c2, _c3, _c4, _c5, _c6, _c7 |FROM spatialdf \"\"\" . stripMargin ) spatialDf . createOrReplaceTempView ( \"spatialdf\" ) spatialDf . show () The first EPSG code EPSG:4326 in ST_Transform is the source CRS of the geometries.

Save to permanent storage \u00b6 To save a Spatial DataFrame to some permanent storage such as Hive tables and HDFS, you can simply convert each geometry in the Geometry type column back to a plain String and save the plain DataFrame to wherever you want. Use the following code to convert the Geometry column in a DataFrame back to a WKT string column: sparkSession . udf . register ( \"ST_SaveAsWKT\" , ( geometry : Geometry ) => ( geometry . toText )) var stringDf = sparkSession . sql ( \"\"\" |SELECT ST_SaveAsWKT(countyshape) |FROM polygondf \"\"\" . stripMargin ) Note We are working on providing more user-friendly output functions such as ST_SaveAsWKT and ST_SaveAsWKB .

The example code is written in Scala but also works for Java . Starting from 1.2.0, GeoSparkViz provides the DataFrame support. This offers users a more flexible way to design beautiful map visualization effects including scatter plots and heat maps. In the meantime, GeoSparkViz RDD API remains the same. Note All GeoSparkViz SQL/DataFrame APIs are explained in GeoSparkViz API . Why scalable map visualization? \u00b6 Data visualization allows users to summarize, analyze and reason about data. Guaranteeing detailed and accurate geospatial map visualization (e.g., at multiple zoom levels) requires extremely high-resolution maps. Classic visualization solutions such as Google Maps, MapBox and ArcGIS suffer from limited computation resources and hence take a tremendous amount of time to generate maps for large-scale geospatial data. In big spatial data scenarios, these tools just crash or run forever. GeoSparkViz encapsulates the main steps of map visualization process, e.g., pixelize, aggregate, and render, into a set of massively parallelized GeoViz operators and the user can assemble any customized styles. Visualize SpatialRDD \u00b6 This tutorial mainly focuses on explaining SQL/DataFrame API. GeoSparkViz RDD example can be found in GeoSpark template project . Set up dependencies \u00b6 Read GeoSpark Maven Central coordinates Add Apache Spark core , Apache SparkSQL , GeoSpark core , GeoSparkSQL , GeoSparkViz Initiate SparkSession \u00b6 Use the following code to initiate your SparkSession at the beginning: This will register GeoSparkVizKryo serializer. var sparkSession = SparkSession . builder () . master ( \"local[*]\" ) // Delete this if run in cluster mode . appName ( \"readTestScala\" ) // Change this to a proper name // Enable GeoSpark custom Kryo serializer . config ( \"spark.serializer\" , classOf [ KryoSerializer ]. getName ) . config ( \"spark.kryo.registrator\" , classOf [ GeoSparkVizKryoRegistrator ]. getName ) . getOrCreate () Register GeoSparkSQL and GeoSparkViz \u00b6 Add the following line after your SparkSession declaration GeoSparkSQLRegistrator . registerAll ( sparkSession ) GeoSparkVizRegistrator . registerAll ( sparkSession ) This will register all User Defined Tyeps, functions and optimizations in GeoSparkSQL and GeoSparkViz. Create Spatial DataFrame \u00b6 There is a DataFrame as follows: +----------+---------+ | _c0| _c1| +----------+---------+ |-88.331492|32.324142| |-88.175933|32.360763| |-88.388954|32.357073| |-88.221102| 32.35078| You first need to create a Geometry type column. CREATE OR REPLACE TEMP VIEW pointtable AS SELECT ST_Point ( cast ( pointtable . _c0 as Decimal ( 24 , 20 )), cast ( pointtable . _c1 as Decimal ( 24 , 20 ))) as shape FROM pointtable As you know, GeoSpark provides many different methods to load various spatial data formats. Please read Write an Spatial DataFrame application . Generate a single image \u00b6 In most cases, you just want to see a single image out of your spatial dataset. Pixelize spatial objects \u00b6 To put spatial objects on a map image, you first need to convert them to pixels. First, compute the spatial boundary of this column. CREATE OR REPLACE TEMP VIEW boundtable AS SELECT ST_Envelope_Aggr ( shape ) as bound FROM pointtable Then use ST_Pixelize to conver them to pixels. CREATE OR REPLACE TEMP VIEW pixels AS SELECT pixel , shape FROM pointtable LATERAL VIEW ST_Pixelize ( ST_Transform ( shape , 'epsg:4326' , 'epsg:3857' ), 256 , 256 , ( SELECT ST_Transform ( bound , 'epsg:4326' , 'epsg:3857' ) FROM boundtable )) AS pixel This will give you a 256*256 resolution image after you run ST_Render at the end of this tutorial. Warning We highly suggest that you should use ST_Transform to transfrom coordiantes to a visualization-specific coordinate sysmte such as epsg:3857. Otherwise you map may look distorted. Aggregate pixels \u00b6 Many objects may be pixelized to the same pixel locations. You now need to aggregate them based on either their spatial aggregation or spatial observations such as temperature or humidity. CREATE OR REPLACE TEMP VIEW pixelaggregates AS SELECT pixel , count ( * ) as weight FROM pixels GROUP BY pixel The weight indicates the degree of spatial aggregation or spatial observations. Later on, it will determine the color of this pixel. Colorize pixels \u00b6 Run the following command to assign colors for pixels based on their weights. CREATE OR REPLACE TEMP VIEW pixelaggregates AS SELECT pixel , ST_Colorize ( weight , ( SELECT max ( weight ) FROM pixelaggregates )) as color FROM pixelaggregates Please read ST_Colorize for a detailed API description. Render the image \u00b6 Use ST_Render to plot all pixels on a single image. CREATE OR REPLACE TEMP VIEW images AS SELECT ST_Render ( pixel , color ) AS image , ( SELECT ST_AsText ( bound ) FROM boundtable ) AS boundary FROM pixelaggregates This DataFrame will contain a Image type column which has only one image. Store the image on disk \u00b6 Fetch the image from the previous DataFrame var image = sparkSession.table(\"images\").take(1)(0)(0).asInstanceOf[ImageSerializableWrapper].getImage Use GeoSparkViz ImageGenerator to store this image on disk. var imageGenerator = new ImageGenerator imageGenerator . SaveRasterImageAsLocalFile ( image , System . getProperty ( \"user.dir\" )+ \"/target/points\" , ImageType . PNG ) Generate map tiles \u00b6 If you are a map tile professional, you may need to generate map tiles for different zoom levels and eventually create the map tile layer. Pixelization and pixel aggregation \u00b6 Please first do pixelization and pixel aggregation using the same commands in single image generation. In ST_Pixelize, you need specify a very high resolution. Create tile name \u00b6 Run the following command to compute the tile name for every pixels CREATE OR REPLACE TEMP VIEW pixelaggregates AS SELECT pixel , weight , ST_TileName ( pixel , 3 ) AS pid FROM pixelaggregates \"3\" is the zoom level for these map tiles. Colorize pixels \u00b6 Use the same command explained in single image generation to assign colors. Render map tiles \u00b6 You now need to group pixels by tiles and then render map tile images in parallel. CREATE OR REPLACE TEMP VIEW images AS SELECT ST_Render ( pixel , color ) AS image FROM pixelaggregates GROUP BY pid Store map tiles on disk \u00b6 You can use the same commands in single image generation to fetch all map tiles and store them one by one.","title":"Visualize Spatial DataFrame"},{"location":"archive/tutorial/viz/#why-scalable-map-visualization","text":"Data visualization allows users to summarize, analyze and reason about data.

GeoSpark Viz None v1.0.0 \u00b6 GeoSpark Core Add GeoSparkConf class to read GeoSparkConf from SparkConf GeoSpark SQL Initial release: fully supports SQL/MM-Part3 Spatial SQL standard GeoSpark Viz Republish GeoSpark Viz under \"GeoSparkViz\" folder. All \"Babylon\" strings have been replaced to \"GeoSparkViz\" v0.9.1 (GeoSpark-core) \u00b6 Bug fixes : Fixed \"Missing values when reading Shapefile\": Issue #141 Performance improvement : Solved Issue #91 , #103 , #104 , #125 , #150 . Add GeoSpark customized Kryo Serializer to significantly reduce memory footprint. This serializer which follows Shapefile compression rule takes less memory than the default Kryo. See PR 139 . Delete the duplicate removal by using Reference Point concept. This eliminates one data shuffle but still guarantees the accuracy. See PR 131 . New Functionalities added : SpatialJoinQueryFlat/DistanceJoinQueryFlat returns the join query in a flat way following database iteration model: Each row has fixed two members [Polygon, Point]. This API is more efficient for unbalanced length of join results. The left and right shapes in Range query, Distance query, Range join query, Distance join query can be switched. The index side in Range query, Distance query, Range join query, Distance join query can be switched. The generic SpatialRdd supports heterogenous geometries Add KDB-Tree spatial partitioning method which is more balanced than Quad-Tree Range query, Distance query, Range join query, Distance join query, KNN query supports heterogenous inputs. v0.8.2 (GeoSpark-core) \u00b6 Bug fixes : Fix the shapefile RDD null pointer bug when running in cluster mode. See Issue https://github.com/DataSystemsLab/GeoSpark/issues/115 New function added : Provide granular control to SpatialRDD sampling utils. SpatialRDD has a setter and getter for a parameter called \"sampleNumber\". The user can manually specify the sample size for spatial partitioning. v0.8.1 (GeoSpark-core) \u00b6 Bug fixes : (1) Fix the blank DBF attribute error when load DBF along with SHX file. (2) Allow user to call CRS transformation function at any time. Previously, it was only allowed in GeoSpark constructors v0.8.0 (GeoSpark-core) \u00b6 New input format added : GeoSpark is able to load and query ESRI ShapeFile (.shp, .shx, .dbf) from local disk and HDFS! Users first need to build a Shapefile RDD by giving Spark Context and an input path then call ShapefileRDD.getSpatialRDD to retrieve Spatial RDD. ( Scala Example , Java Example ) Join Query Performance enhancement 1 : GeoSpark provides a new Quad-Tree Spatial Partitioning method to speed up Join Query. Users need to pass GridType.QUADTREE parameter to RDD1.spatialPartitioning() function. Then users need to use RDD1.partitionTree in RDD2.spatialPartitioning() function. This Quad-Tree partitioning method (1) avoids overflowed spatial objects when partitioning spatial objects. (2) checking a spatial object against the Quad-Tree grids is completed in a log complexity tree search. ( Scala Example , Java Example ) Join Query Performance enhancement 2 : Internally, GeoSpark uses zipPartitions instead of CoGroup to join two Spatial RDD so that the incurred shuffle overhead decreases. SpatialRDD Initialization Performance enhancement : GeoSpark uses mapPartition instead of flatMapToPair to generate Spatial Objects. This will speed up the calculation. API changed : Since it chooses mapPartition API in mappers, GeoSpark no longer supports the old user supplified format mapper. However, if you are using your own format mapper for old GeoSpark version, you just need to add one more loop to fit in GeoSpark 0.8.0. Please see GeoSpark user supplied format mapper examples Alternative SpatialRDD constructor added : GeoSpark no longer forces users to provide StorageLevel parameter in their SpatialRDD constructors. This will siginicantly accelerate all Spatial RDD initialization. If he only needs Spatial Range Query and KNN query, the user can totally remove this parameter from their constructors. If he needs Spatial Join Query or Distance Join Query but he knows his dataset boundary and approximate total count, the user can also remove StorageLevel parameter and append a Envelope type dataset boundary and an approxmiate total count as additional parameters. If he needs Spatial Join Query or Distance Join Query but knows nothing about his dataset , the user still has to pass StorageLevel parameter. Bug fix : Fix bug Issue #97 and Issue #100 . v0.1 - v0.7 \u00b6 Version Summary 0.7.0 Coordinate Reference System (CRS) Transformation (aka. Coordinate projection) added: GeoSpark allows users to transform the original CRS (e.g., degree based coordinates such as EPSG:4326 and WGS84) to any other CRS (e.g., meter based coordinates such as EPSG:3857) so that it can accurately process both geographic data and geometrical data. Please specify your desired CRS in GeoSpark Spatial RDD constructor ( Example ); Unnecessary dependencies removed : NetCDF/HDF support depends on SerNetCDF . SetNetCDF becomes optional dependency to reduce fat jar size; Default JDK/JRE change to JDK/JRE 1.8 : To satisfy CRS transformation requirement, GeoSpark is compiled by JDK 1.8 by default; Bug fix : fix a small format bug when output spatial RDD to disk. 0.6.2 New input format added: Add a new input format mapper called EarthdataHDFPointMapper so that GeoSpark can load, query and save NASA Petabytes NetCDF/HDF Earth Data ( Scala Example , Java Example ); Bug fix: Print UserData attribute when output Spatial RDDs as GeoJSON or regular text file 0.6.1 Bug fixes: Fix typos LineString DistanceJoin API 0.6.0 Major updates: (1) DistanceJoin is merged into JoinQuery. GeoSpark now supports complete DistanceJoin between Points, Polygons, and LineStrings. (2) Add Refine Phase to Spatial Range and Join Query. Use real polygon coordinates instead of its MBR to filter the final results. API changes: All spatial range and join queries now take a parameter called ConsiderBoundaryIntersection . This will tell GeoSpark whether returns the objects intersect with windows. 0.5.3 Bug fix: Fix Issue #69 : Now, if two objects have the same coordinates but different non-spatial attributes (UserData), GeoSpark treats them as different objects. 0.5.2 Bug fix: Fix Issue #58 and Issue #60 ; Performance enhancement: (1) Deprecate all old Spatial RDD constructors. See the JavaDoc here . (2) Recommend the new SRDD constructors which take an additional RDD storage level and automatically cache rawSpatialRDD to accelerate internal SRDD analyze step 0.5.1 Bug fix: (1) GeoSpark: Fix inaccurate KNN result when K is large (2) GeoSpark: Replace incompatible Spark API call Issue #55 ; (3) Babylon: Remove JPG output format temporarily due to the lack of OpenJDK support 0.5.0 Major updates: We are pleased to announce the initial version of Babylon a large-scale in-memory geospatial visualization system extending GeoSpark. Babylon and GeoSpark are integrated together. You can just import GeoSpark and enjoy! More details are available here: Babylon GeoSpatial Visualization 0.4.0 Major updates: ( Example ) 1. Refactor constrcutor API usage. 2. Simplify Spatial Join Query API. 3. Add native support for LineStringRDD; Functionality enhancement: 1. Release the persist function back to users. 2. Add more exception explanations. 0.3.2 Functionality enhancement: 1. JTSplus Spatial Objects now carry the original input data. Each object stores \"UserData\" and provides getter and setter. 2. Add a new SpatialRDD constructor to transform a regular data RDD to a spatial partitioned SpatialRDD. 0.3.1 Bug fix: Support Apache Spark 2.X version, fix a bug which results in inaccurate results when doing join query, add more unit test cases 0.3 Major updates: Significantly shorten query time on spatial join for skewed data; Support load balanced spatial partitioning methods (also serve as the global index); Optimize code for iterative spatial data mining 0.2 Improve code structure and refactor API 0.1 Support spatial range, join and Knn GeoSpark-Viz (old) \u00b6 Version Summary 0.2.2 Add the support of new output storage : Now the user is able to output gigapixel or megapixel resolution images (image tiles or stitched single image) to HDFS and Amazon S3. Please use the new ImageGenerator not the BabylonImageGenerator class. 0.2.1 Performance enhancement : significantly accelerate single image generation pipeline. Bug fix :fix a bug in scatter plot parallel rendering. 0.2.0 API updates for Issue #80 : 1. Babylon now has two different OverlayOperators for raster image and vector image: RasterOverlayOperator and VectorOverlayOperator; 2. Babylon merged old SparkImageGenerator and NativeJavaGenerator into a new BabylonImageGenerator which has neat APIs; New feature: Babylon can use Scatter Plot to visualize NASA Petabytes NetCDF/HDF format Earth Data. ( Scala Example , Java Example ) 0.1.1 Major updates: Babylon supports vector image and outputs SVG image format 0.1.0 Major updates: Babylon initial version supports raster images","title":"Release notes"},{"location":"download/GeoSpark-All-Modules-Release-notes/#v131","text":"This version includes the official release of GeoSpark Python wrapper.

Users first need to build a Shapefile RDD by giving Spark Context and an input path then call ShapefileRDD.getSpatialRDD to retrieve Spatial RDD. ( Scala Example , Java Example ) Join Query Performance enhancement 1 : GeoSpark provides a new Quad-Tree Spatial Partitioning method to speed up Join Query. Users need to pass GridType.QUADTREE parameter to RDD1.spatialPartitioning() function. Then users need to use RDD1.partitionTree in RDD2.spatialPartitioning() function. This Quad-Tree partitioning method (1) avoids overflowed spatial objects when partitioning spatial objects. (2) checking a spatial object against the Quad-Tree grids is completed in a log complexity tree search. ( Scala Example , Java Example ) Join Query Performance enhancement 2 : Internally, GeoSpark uses zipPartitions instead of CoGroup to join two Spatial RDD so that the incurred shuffle overhead decreases. SpatialRDD Initialization Performance enhancement : GeoSpark uses mapPartition instead of flatMapToPair to generate Spatial Objects. This will speed up the calculation. API changed : Since it chooses mapPartition API in mappers, GeoSpark no longer supports the old user supplified format mapper. However, if you are using your own format mapper for old GeoSpark version, you just need to add one more loop to fit in GeoSpark 0.8.0. Please see GeoSpark user supplied format mapper examples Alternative SpatialRDD constructor added : GeoSpark no longer forces users to provide StorageLevel parameter in their SpatialRDD constructors. This will siginicantly accelerate all Spatial RDD initialization. If he only needs Spatial Range Query and KNN query, the user can totally remove this parameter from their constructors. If he needs Spatial Join Query or Distance Join Query but he knows his dataset boundary and approximate total count, the user can also remove StorageLevel parameter and append a Envelope type dataset boundary and an approxmiate total count as additional parameters. If he needs Spatial Join Query or Distance Join Query but knows nothing about his dataset , the user still has to pass StorageLevel parameter.

Coordinate projection) added: GeoSpark allows users to transform the original CRS (e.g., degree based coordinates such as EPSG:4326 and WGS84) to any other CRS (e.g., meter based coordinates such as EPSG:3857) so that it can accurately process both geographic data and geometrical data. Please specify your desired CRS in GeoSpark Spatial RDD constructor ( Example ); Unnecessary dependencies removed : NetCDF/HDF support depends on SerNetCDF . SetNetCDF becomes optional dependency to reduce fat jar size; Default JDK/JRE change to JDK/JRE 1.8 : To satisfy CRS transformation requirement, GeoSpark is compiled by JDK 1.8 by default; Bug fix : fix a small format bug when output spatial RDD to disk. 0.6.2 New input format added: Add a new input format mapper called EarthdataHDFPointMapper so that GeoSpark can load, query and save NASA Petabytes NetCDF/HDF Earth Data ( Scala Example , Java Example ); Bug fix: Print UserData attribute when output Spatial RDDs as GeoJSON or regular text file 0.6.1 Bug fixes: Fix typos LineString DistanceJoin API 0.6.0 Major updates: (1) DistanceJoin is merged into JoinQuery. GeoSpark now supports complete DistanceJoin between Points, Polygons, and LineStrings. (2) Add Refine Phase to Spatial Range and Join Query. Use real polygon coordinates instead of its MBR to filter the final results. API changes: All spatial range and join queries now take a parameter called ConsiderBoundaryIntersection . This will tell GeoSpark whether returns the objects intersect with windows. 0.5.3 Bug fix: Fix Issue #69 : Now, if two objects have the same coordinates but different non-spatial attributes (UserData), GeoSpark treats them as different objects. 0.5.2 Bug fix: Fix Issue #58 and Issue #60 ; Performance enhancement: (1) Deprecate all old Spatial RDD constructors. See the JavaDoc here . (2) Recommend the new SRDD constructors which take an additional RDD storage level and automatically cache rawSpatialRDD to accelerate internal SRDD analyze step 0.5.1 Bug fix: (1) GeoSpark: Fix inaccurate KNN result when K is large (2) GeoSpark: Replace incompatible Spark API call Issue #55 ; (3) Babylon: Remove JPG output format temporarily due to the lack of OpenJDK support 0.5.0 Major updates: We are pleased to announce the initial version of Babylon a large-scale in-memory geospatial visualization system extending GeoSpark.

Pick a proper GeoSpark version \u00b6 The versions of GeoSpark have three levels: X.X.X (i.e., 0.8.1). In addition, GeoSpark also supports Spark 1.X in Spark1.X version. The first level means that this verion contains big structure redesign which may bring big changes in APIs and performance. Hopefully, we can see these big changes in GeoSpark 1.X version. The second level (i.e., 0.8) indicates that this version contains significant performance enhancement, big new features and API changes. An old GeoSpark user who wants to pick this version needs to be careful about the API changes. Before you move to this version, please read GeoSpark version release notes and make sure you are ready to accept the API changes. The third level (i.e., 0.8.1) tells that this version only contains bug fixes, some small new features and slight performance enhancement. This version will not contain any API changes. Moving to this version is safe. We highly suggest all GeoSpark users that stay at the same level move to the latest version in this level. Choose a proper Spatial RDD constructor \u00b6 GeoSpark provides a number of constructors for each SpatialRDD (PointRDD, PolygonRDD and LineStringRDD). In general, you have two options to start with. Initialize a SpatialRDD from your data source such as HDFS and S3. A typical example is as follows: public PointRDD ( JavaSparkContext sparkContext , String InputLocation , Integer Offset , FileDataSplitter splitter , boolean carryInputData , Integer partitions , StorageLevel newLevel ) Initialize a SpatialRDD from an existing RDD. A typical example is as follows: public PointRDD ( JavaRDD < Point > rawSpatialRDD , StorageLevel newLevel ) You may notice that these constructors all take as input a \"StorageLevel\" parameter. This is to tell Apache Spark cache the \"rawSpatialRDD\", one attribute of SpatialRDD. The reason why GeoSpark does this is that GeoSpark wants to calculate the dataset boundary and approximate total count using several Apache Spark \"Action\"s. These information are useful when doing Spatial Join Query and Distance Join Query. However, in some cases, you may know well about your datasets. If so, you can manually provide these information by calling this kind of Spatial RDD constructors: public PointRDD ( JavaSparkContext sparkContext , String InputLocation , Integer Offset , FileDataSplitter splitter , boolean carryInputData , Integer partitions , Envelope datasetBoundary , Integer approximateTotalCount ) { Manually providing the dataset boundary and approxmiate total count helps GeoSpark avoiding several slow \"Action\"s during initialization. Cache the Spatial RDD that is repeatedly used \u00b6 Each SpatialRDD (PointRDD, PolygonRDD and LineStringRDD) possesses four RDD attributes. They are: rawSpatialRDD: The RDD generated by SpatialRDD constructors. spatialPartitionedRDD: The RDD generated by spatial partition a rawSpatialRDD. Note that: this RDD has replicated spatial objects. indexedRawRDD: The RDD generated by indexing a rawSpatialRDD. indexedRDD: The RDD generated by indexing a spatialPartitionedRDD. Note that: this RDD has replicated spatial objects. These four RDDs don't co-exist so you don't need to worry about the memory issue. These four RDDs are invoked in different queries: Spatial Range Query / KNN Query, no index: rawSpatialRDD is used. Spatial Range Query / KNN Query, use index: indexedRawRDD is used. Spatial Join Query / Distance Join Query, no index: spatialPartitionedRDD is used. Spatial Join Query / Distance Join Query, use index: indexed RDD is used. Therefore, if you use one of the queries above many times, you'd better cache the associated RDD into memory. There are several possible use cases: In Spatial Data Mining such as Spatial Autocorrelation and Spatial Co-location Pattern Mining, you may need to use Spatial Join / Spatial Self-join iteratively in order to calculate the adjacency matrix. If so, please cache the spatialPartitionedRDD/indexedRDD which is queries many times. In Spark RDD sharing applications such as Livy and Spark Job Server , many users may do Spatial Range Query / KNN Query on the same Spatial RDD with different query predicates. You'd better cache the rawSpatialRDD/indexedRawRDD. Be aware of Spatial RDD partitions \u00b6 Sometimes users complain that the execution time is slow in some cases. As the first step, you should always consider increasing the number of your SpatialRDD partitions (2 - 8 times more than the original number). You can do this when you initialize a SpatialRDD. This may significantly improve your performance. After that, you may consider tuning some other parameters in Apache Spark. For example, you may use Kyro serializer or change the RDD fraction that is cached into memory.","title":"Tune GeoSpark RDD application"},{"location":"tutorial/Advanced-Tutorial-Tune-your-GeoSpark-Application/#advanced-tutorial-tune-your-geospark-rdd-application","text":"Before getting into this advanced tutorial, please make sure that you have tried several GeoSpark functions on your local machine.","title":"Advanced tutorial: Tune your GeoSpark RDD application"},{"location":"tutorial/Advanced-Tutorial-Tune-your-GeoSpark-Application/#pick-a-proper-geospark-version","text":"The versions of GeoSpark have three levels: X.X.X (i.e., 0.8.1).

If so, please cache the spatialPartitionedRDD/indexedRDD which is queries many times. In Spark RDD sharing applications such as Livy and Spark Job Server , many users may do Spatial Range Query / KNN Query on the same Spatial RDD with different query predicates. You'd better cache the rawSpatialRDD/indexedRawRDD.","title":"Cache the Spatial RDD that is repeatedly used"},{"location":"tutorial/Advanced-Tutorial-Tune-your-GeoSpark-Application/#be-aware-of-spatial-rdd-partitions","text":"Sometimes users complain that the execution time is slow in some cases. As the first step, you should always consider increasing the number of your SpatialRDD partitions (2 - 8 times more than the original number). You can do this when you initialize a SpatialRDD.

GeoSpark SpatialRDDs (and other classes when it was necessary) have implemented meta classes which allow to use overloaded functions, methods and constructors to be the most similar to Java/Scala API as possible. GeoSpark-core provides five special SpatialRDDs: PointRDD PolygonRDD LineStringRDD CircleRDD RectangleRDD All of them can be imported from geospark.core.SpatialRDD module geospark has written serializers which convert GeoSpark SpatialRDD to Python objects. Converting will produce GeoData objects which have 2 attributes: geom: shapely.geometry.BaseGeometry userData: str geom attribute holds geometry representation as shapely objects. userData is string representation of other attributes separated by \"\\t\" GeoData has one method to get user data. getUserData() -> str Installing the package \u00b6 GeoSpark extends pyspark functions which depend on Python packages and Scala libraries. To see all dependencies please look at the dependencies section. https://pypi.org/project/pyspark/ . This package needs 2 jar files to work properly: geospark.jar geo_wrapper.jar Note To enable GeoSpark Core functionality without GeoSparkSQL there is no need to copy jar files from geospark/jars location. You can use jar files from Maven repositories. Since GeoSpark 1.3.0 it is possible also to use maven jars for GeoSparkSQL instead of geospark/jars/../geospark-sql jars files. This package automatically copies the newest GeoSpark jar files using upload_jars function, please follow the example below. upload_jars from pyspark.sql import SparkSession from geospark.register import upload_jars from geospark.register import GeoSparkRegistrator upload_jars () spark = SparkSession . builder . \\ getOrCreate () GeoSparkRegistrator . registerAll ( spark ) Function upload_jars () uses findspark Python package to upload jar files to executor and nodes. To avoid copying all the time, jar files can be put in directory SPARK_HOME/jars or any other path specified in Spark config files. Installing from PyPi repositories \u00b6 Please use command below pip install geospark Installing from wheel file \u00b6 pipenv run python -m pip install dist/geospark-1.3.1-py3-none-any.whl or pip install dist/geospark-1.3.1-py3-none-any.whl Installing from source \u00b6 python3 setup.py install GeoSpark Serializers \u00b6 GeoSpark has a suite of well-written geometry and index serializers. Forgetting to enable these serializers will lead to high memory consumption. conf . set ( \"spark.serializer\" , KryoSerializer . getName ) conf . set ( \"spark.kryo.registrator\" , GeoSparkKryoRegistrator . getName ) Create a SpatialRDD \u00b6 Create a typed SpatialRDD \u00b6 GeoSpark-core provides three special SpatialRDDs: PointRDD PolygonRDD LineStringRDD CircleRDD RectangleRDD They can be loaded from CSV, TSV, WKT, WKB, Shapefiles, GeoJSON formats. To pass the format to SpatialRDD constructor please use FileDataSplitter enumeration. geospark SpatialRDDs (and other classes when it was necessary) have implemented meta classes which allow to use overloaded functions how Scala/Java GeoSpark API allows. ex. from pyspark import StorageLevel from geospark.core.SpatialRDD import PointRDD from geospark.core.enums import FileDataSplitter input_location = \"checkin.csv\" offset = 0 # The point long/lat starts from Column 0 splitter = FileDataSplitter . CSV # FileDataSplitter enumeration carry_other_attributes = True # Carry Column 2 (hotel, gas, bar...) level = StorageLevel .

Read other attributes in an SpatialRDD \u00b6 Each SpatialRDD can carry non-spatial attributes such as price, age and name as long as the user sets carryOtherAttributes as TRUE . The other attributes are combined together to a string and stored in UserData field of each geometry. To retrieve the UserData field, use the following code: rdd_with_other_attributes = object_rdd . rawSpatialRDD . map ( lambda x : x . getUserData ()) Write a Spatial Range Query \u00b6 from geospark.core.geom.envelope import Envelope from geospark.core.spatialOperator import RangeQuery range_query_window = Envelope ( - 90.01 , - 80.01 , 30.01 , 40.01 ) consider_boundary_intersection = False ## Only return gemeotries fully covered by the window using_index = False query_result = RangeQuery . SpatialRangeQuery ( spatial_rdd , range_query_window , consider_boundary_intersection , using_index ) Range query window \u00b6 Besides the rectangle (Envelope) type range query window, GeoSpark range query window can be Point Polygon LineString The code to create a point is as follows: To create shapely geometries please follow official shapely documentation Use spatial indexes \u00b6 GeoSpark provides two types of spatial indexes, Quad-Tree R-Tree Once you specify an index type, GeoSpark will build a local tree index on each of the SpatialRDD partition. To utilize a spatial index in a spatial range query, use the following code: from geospark.core.geom.envelope import Envelope from geospark.core.enums import IndexType from geospark.core.spatialOperator import RangeQuery range_query_window = Envelope ( - 90.01 , - 80.01 , 30.01 , 40.01 ) consider_boundary_intersection = False ## Only return gemeotries fully covered by the window build_on_spatial_partitioned_rdd = False ## Set to TRUE only if run join query spatial_rdd . buildIndex ( IndexType . QUADTREE , build_on_spatial_partitioned_rdd ) using_index = True query_result = RangeQuery . SpatialRangeQuery ( spatial_rdd , range_query_window , consider_boundary_intersection , using_index ) Output format \u00b6 The output format of the spatial range query is another RDD which consists of GeoData objects. SpatialRangeQuery result can be used as RDD with map or other spark RDD funtions. Also it can be used as Python objects when using collect method. Example: query_result . map ( lambda x : x . geom . length ) . collect () [ 1.5900840000000045, 1.5906639999999896, 1.1110299999999995, 1.1096700000000084, 1.1415619999999933, 1.1386399999999952, 1.1415619999999933, 1.1418860000000137, 1.1392780000000045, ... ] Or transformed to GeoPandas GeoDataFrame import geopandas as gpd gpd . GeoDataFrame ( query_result . map ( lambda x : [ x . geom , x . userData ]) . collect (), columns = [ \"geom\" , \"user_data\" ], geometry = \"geom\" ) Write a Spatial KNN Query \u00b6 A spatial K Nearnest Neighbor query takes as input a K, a query point and an SpatialRDD and finds the K geometries in the RDD which are the closest to he query point. Assume you now have an SpatialRDD (typed or generic). You can use the following code to issue an Spatial KNN Query on it. from geospark.core.spatialOperator import KNNQuery from shapely.geometry import Point point = Point ( - 84.01 , 34.01 ) k = 1000 ## K Nearest Neighbors using_index = False result = KNNQuery . SpatialKnnQuery ( object_rdd , point , k , using_index ) Query center geometry \u00b6 Besides the Point type, GeoSpark KNN query center can be Polygon LineString To create Polygon or Linestring object please follow Shapely official documentation Use spatial indexes \u00b6 To utilize a spatial index in a spatial KNN query, use the following code: from geospark.core.spatialOperator import KNNQuery from geospark.core.enums import IndexType from shapely.geometry import Point point = Point ( - 84.01 , 34.01 ) k = 5 ## K Nearest Neighbors build_on_spatial_partitioned_rdd = False ## Set to TRUE only if run join query spatial_rdd . buildIndex ( IndexType . RTREE , build_on_spatial_partitioned_rdd ) using_index = True result = KNNQuery . SpatialKnnQuery ( spatial_rdd , point , k , using_index ) Warning Only R-Tree index supports Spatial KNN query Output format \u00b6 The output format of the spatial KNN query is a list of GeoData objects. The list has K GeoData objects. Example: >> result [ GeoData , GeoData , GeoData , GeoData , GeoData ] Write a Spatial Join Query \u00b6 A spatial join query takes as input two Spatial RDD A and B. For each geometry in A, finds the geometries (from B) covered/intersected by it. A and B can be any geometry type and are not necessary to have the same geometry type. Assume you now have two SpatialRDDs (typed or generic). You can use the following code to issue an Spatial Join Query on them. from geospark.core.enums import GridType from geospark.core.spatialOperator import JoinQuery consider_boundary_intersection = False ## Only return geometries fully covered by each query window in queryWindowRDD using_index = False object_rdd . analyze () object_rdd . spatialPartitioning ( GridType . KDBTREE ) query_window_rdd . spatialPartitioning ( object_rdd . getPartitioner ()) result = JoinQuery . SpatialJoinQuery ( object_rdd , query_window_rdd , using_index , consider_boundary_intersection ) Result of SpatialJoinQuery is RDD which consists of GeoData instance and list of GeoData instances which spatially intersects or are covered by GeoData. result . collect ()) [ [GeoData, [GeoData, GeoData, GeoData, GeoData]], [GeoData, [GeoData, GeoData, GeoData]], [GeoData, [GeoData]], [GeoData, [GeoData, GeoData]], ... [GeoData, [GeoData, GeoData]] ] Use spatial partitioning \u00b6 GeoSpark spatial partitioning method can significantly speed up the join query. Three spatial partitioning methods are available: KDB-Tree, Quad-Tree and R-Tree. Two SpatialRDD must be partitioned by the same way. If you first partition SpatialRDD A, then you must use the partitioner of A to partition B. object_rdd . spatialPartitioning ( GridType . KDBTREE ) query_window_rdd . spatialPartitioning ( object_rdd . getPartitioner ()) Or query_window_rdd . spatialPartitioning ( GridType . KDBTREE ) object_rdd . spatialPartitioning ( query_window_rdd . getPartitioner ()) Use spatial indexes \u00b6 To utilize a spatial index in a spatial join query, use the following code: from geospark.core.enums import GridType from geospark.core.enums import IndexType from geospark.core.spatialOperator import JoinQuery object_rdd . spatialPartitioning ( GridType . KDBTREE ) query_window_rdd . spatialPartitioning ( object_rdd . getPartitioner ()) build_on_spatial_partitioned_rdd = True ## Set to TRUE only if run join query using_index = True query_window_rdd . buildIndex ( IndexType . QUADTREE , build_on_spatial_partitioned_rdd ) result = JoinQuery . SpatialJoinQueryFlat ( object_rdd , query_window_rdd , using_index , True ) The index should be built on either one of two SpatialRDDs. In general, you should build it on the larger SpatialRDD. Output format \u00b6 The output format of the spatial join query is a PairRDD. In this PairRDD, each object is a pair of two GeoData objects. The left one is the GeoData from object_rdd and the right one is the GeoData from the query_window_rdd. Point,Polygon Point,Polygon Point,Polygon Polygon,Polygon LineString,LineString Polygon,LineString ... example result . collect () [ [GeoData, GeoData], [GeoData, GeoData], [GeoData, GeoData], [GeoData, GeoData], ... [GeoData, GeoData], [GeoData, GeoData] ] Each object on the left is covered/intersected by the object on the right. Write a Distance Join Query \u00b6 A distance join query takes two spatial RDD assuming that we have two SpatialRDD's: object_rdd spatial_rdd And finds the geometries (from spatial_rdd) are within given distance to it. spatial_rdd and object_rdd can be any geometry type (point, line, polygon) and are not necessary to have the same geometry type You can use the following code to issue an Distance Join Query on them. from geospark.core.SpatialRDD import CircleRDD from geospark.core.enums import GridType from geospark.core.spatialOperator import JoinQuery object_rdd . analyze () circle_rdd = CircleRDD ( object_rdd , 0.1 ) ## Create a CircleRDD using the given distance circle_rdd . analyze () circle_rdd . spatialPartitioning ( GridType . KDBTREE ) spatial_rdd . spatialPartitioning ( circle_rdd . getPartitioner ()) consider_boundary_intersection = False ## Only return gemeotries fully covered by each query window in queryWindowRDD using_index = False result = JoinQuery . DistanceJoinQueryFlat ( spatial_rdd , circle_rdd , using_index , consider_boundary_intersection ) Output format \u00b6 Result for this query is RDD which holds two GeoData objects within list of lists. Example: result . collect () [[GeoData, GeoData], [GeoData, GeoData] ...] It is possible to do some RDD operation on result data ex. Getting polygon centroid. result . map ( lambda x : x [ 0 ] . geom . centroid ) . collect () [ <shapely.geometry.point.Point at 0x7efee2d28128>, <shapely.geometry.point.Point at 0x7efee2d280b8>, <shapely.geometry.point.Point at 0x7efee2d28fd0>, <shapely.geometry.point.Point at 0x7efee2d28080>, ... ] Save to permanent storage \u00b6 You can always save an SpatialRDD back to some permanent storage such as HDFS and Amazon S3. You can save distributed SpatialRDD to WKT, GeoJSON and object files. Note Non-spatial attributes such as price, age and name will also be stored to permanent storage. Save an SpatialRDD (not indexed) \u00b6 Typed SpatialRDD and generic SpatialRDD can be saved to permanent storage. Save to distributed WKT text file \u00b6 Use the following code to save an SpatialRDD as a distributed WKT text file: object_rdd . rawSpatialRDD . saveAsTextFile ( \"hdfs://PATH\" ) object_rdd . saveAsWKT ( \"hdfs://PATH\" ) Save to distributed WKB text file \u00b6 Use the following code to save an SpatialRDD as a distributed WKB text file: object_rdd . saveAsWKB ( \"hdfs://PATH\" ) Save to distributed GeoJSON text file \u00b6 Use the following code to save an SpatialRDD as a distributed GeoJSON text file: object_rdd . saveAsGeoJSON ( \"hdfs://PATH\" ) Save to distributed object file \u00b6 Use the following code to save an SpatialRDD as a distributed object file: object_rdd . rawJvmSpatialRDD . saveAsObjectFile ( \"hdfs://PATH\" ) Note Each object in a distributed object file is a byte array (not human-readable). This byte array is the serialized format of a Geometry or a SpatialIndex. Save an SpatialRDD (indexed) \u00b6 Indexed typed SpatialRDD and generic SpatialRDD can be saved to permanent storage. However, the indexed SpatialRDD has to be stored as a distributed object file. Save to distributed object file \u00b6 Use the following code to save an SpatialRDD as a distributed object file: object_rdd . indexedRawRDD . saveAsObjectFile ( \"hdfs://PATH\" ) Save an SpatialRDD (spatialPartitioned W/O indexed) \u00b6 A spatial partitioned RDD can be saved to permanent storage but Spark is not able to maintain the same RDD partition Id of the original RDD. This will lead to wrong join query results. We are working on some solutions. Stay tuned! Reload a saved SpatialRDD \u00b6 You can easily reload an SpatialRDD that has been saved to a distributed object file . Load to a typed SpatialRDD \u00b6 Use the following code to reload the PointRDD/PolygonRDD/LineStringRDD: from geospark.core.formatMapper.disc_utils import load_spatial_rdd_from_disc , GeoType polygon_rdd = load_spatial_rdd_from_disc ( sc , \"hdfs://PATH\" , GeoType .

The official repository for GeoSpark can be found at https://github.com/DataSystemsLab/GeoSpark . This package allows users to use all GeoSparkSQL functions and transform it to Python Shapely geometry objects. Also it allows to create Spark DataFrame with GeoSpark UDT from Shapely geometry objects. Spark DataFrame can be converted to GeoPandas easily, in addition all fiona drivers for shape file are available to load data from files and convert them to Spark DataFrame. Please look at examples. Installation \u00b6 GeoSpark extends pyspark functions which depends on Python packages and Scala libraries. To see all dependencies please look at Dependencies section. https://pypi.org/project/pyspark/ . Package needs 2 jar files to work properly: geospark.jar geospark-sql.jar geo_wrapper.jar Note Since GeoSpark 1.3.0 it is possible also to use maven jars for GeoSparkSQL instead of geospark/jars/../geospark-sql jars files. This package automatically copies the newest GeoSpark jar files using function, please follow the example below. upload_jars from pyspark.sql import SparkSession from geospark.register import upload_jars from geospark.register import GeoSparkRegistrator upload_jars () spark = SparkSession . builder . \\ getOrCreate () GeoSparkRegistrator . registerAll ( spark ) Function upload_jars () uses findspark Python package to upload jar files to executor and nodes. To avoid copying all the time, jar files can be put in directory SPARK_HOME/jars or any other path specified in Spark config files. Installing from PyPi repositories \u00b6 Please use command below pip install geospark Installing from wheel file \u00b6 pipenv run python -m pip install dist/geospark-1.3.1-py3-none-any.whl or pip install dist/geospark-1.3.1-py3-none-any.whl Installing from source \u00b6 python3 setup.py install Core Classes and methods. \u00b6 GeoSparkRegistrator.registerAll(spark: pyspark.sql.SparkSession) -> bool This is the core of whole package. Class method registers all GeoSparkSQL functions (available for used GeoSparkSQL version). To check available functions please look at GeoSparkSQL section. :param spark: pyspark.sql.SparkSession, spark session instance upload_jars() -> NoReturn Function uses findspark Python module to upload newest GeoSpark jars to Spark executor and nodes. GeometryType() Class which handle serialization and deserialization between GeoSpark geometries and Shapely BaseGeometry types. KryoSerializer.getName -> str Class property which returns org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoSerializer string, which simplify using GeoSpark Serializers. GeoSparkKryoRegistrator.getName -> str Class property which returns org.datasyslab.geospark.serde.GeoSparkKryoRegistrator string, which simplify using GeoSpark Serializers. Writing Application \u00b6 Use KryoSerializer.getName and GeoSparkKryoRegistrator.getName class properties to reduce memory impact, reffering to GeoSpark docs . To do that use spark config as follows: . config ( \"spark.serializer\" , KryoSerializer . getName ) . config ( \"spark.kryo.registrator\" , GeoSparkKryoRegistrator . getName ) If jars was not uploaded manually please use function upload_jars() To turn on GeoSparkSQL function inside pyspark code use GeoSparkRegistrator.registerAll method on existing pyspark.sql.SparkSession instance ex. GeoSparkRegistrator.registerAll(spark) After that all the functions from GeoSparkSQL will be available, moreover using collect or toPandas methods on Spark DataFrame will return Shapely BaseGeometry objects. Based on GeoPandas DataFrame, Pandas DataFrame with shapely objects or Sequence with shapely objects, Spark DataFrame can be created using spark.createDataFrame method. To specify Schema with geometry inside please use GeometryType() instance (look at examples section to see that in practice). Examples \u00b6 GeoSparkSQL \u00b6 All GeoSparkSQL functions (list depends on GeoSparkSQL version) are available in Python API.

The example code is written in Scala but also works for Java . Set up dependencies \u00b6 Read GeoSpark Maven Central coordinates Select the minimum dependencies : Add Apache Spark (only the Spark core) and GeoSpark (core). Add the dependencies in build.sbt or pom.xml. Note To enjoy the full functions of GeoSpark, we suggest you include the full dependencies : Apache Spark core , Apache SparkSQL , GeoSpark core , GeoSparkSQL , GeoSparkViz Initiate SparkContext \u00b6 val conf = new SparkConf () conf . setAppName ( \"GeoSparkRunnableExample\" ) // Change this to a proper name conf . setMaster ( \"local[*]\" ) // Delete this if run in cluster mode // Enable GeoSpark custom Kryo serializer conf . set ( \"spark.serializer\" , classOf [ KryoSerializer ]. getName ) conf . set ( \"spark.kryo.registrator\" , classOf [ GeoSparkKryoRegistrator ]. getName ) val sc = new SparkContext ( conf ) Warning GeoSpark has a suite of well-written geometry and index serializers. Forgetting to enable these serializers will lead to high memory consumption. If you add the GeoSpark full dependencies as suggested above, please use the following two lines to enable GeoSpark Kryo serializer instead: conf . set ( \"spark.serializer\" , classOf [ KryoSerializer ]. getName ) conf . set ( \"spark.kryo.registrator\" , classOf [ GeoSparkVizKryoRegistrator ]. getName ) Create a SpatialRDD \u00b6 Create a typed SpatialRDD \u00b6 GeoSpark-core provides three special SpatialRDDs: PointRDD, PolygonRDD, and LineStringRDD . They can be loaded from CSV, TSV, WKT, WKB, Shapefiles, GeoJSON and NetCDF/HDF format. PointRDD from CSV/TSV \u00b6 Suppose we have a checkin.csv CSV file at Path /Download/checkin.csv as follows: -88.331492,32.324142,hotel -88.175933,32.360763,gas -88.388954,32.357073,bar -88.221102,32.35078,restaurant This file has three columns and corresponding offsets (Column IDs) are 0, 1, 2. Use the following code to create a PointRDD val pointRDDInputLocation = \"/Download/checkin.csv\" val pointRDDOffset = 0 // The point long/lat starts from Column 0 val pointRDDSplitter = FileDataSplitter . CSV val carryOtherAttributes = true // Carry Column 2 (hotel, gas, bar...) var objectRDD = new PointRDD ( sc , pointRDDInputLocation , pointRDDOffset , pointRDDSplitter , carryOtherAttributes ) If the data file is in TSV format, just simply use the following line to replace the old FileDataSplitter: val pointRDDSplitter = FileDataSplitter . TSV PolygonRDD/LineStringRDD from CSV/TSV \u00b6 In general, polygon and line string data is stored in WKT, WKB, GeoJSON and Shapefile formats instead of CSV/TSV because the geometries in a file may have different lengths. However, if all polygons / line strings in your CSV/TSV possess the same length, you can create PolygonRDD and LineStringRDD from these files. Suppose we have a checkinshape.csv CSV file at Path /Download/checkinshape.csv as follows: -88.331492,32.324142,-88.331492,32.324142,-88.331492,32.324142,-88.331492,32.324142,-88.331492,32.324142,hotel -88.175933,32.360763,-88.175933,32.360763,-88.175933,32.360763,-88.175933,32.360763,-88.175933,32.360763,gas -88.388954,32.357073,-88.388954,32.357073,-88.388954,32.357073,-88.388954,32.357073,-88.388954,32.357073,bar -88.221102,32.35078,-88.221102,32.35078,-88.221102,32.35078,-88.221102,32.35078,-88.221102,32.35078,restaurant This file has 11 columns and corresponding offsets (Column IDs) are 0 - 10. Column 0 - 9 are 5 coordinates (longitude/latitude pairs). In this file, all geometries have the same number of coordinates. The geometries can be polyons or line strings. Warning For polygon data, the last coordinate must be the same as the first coordinate because a polygon is a closed linear ring. Use the following code to create a PolygonRDD. val polygonRDDInputLocation = \"/Download/checkinshape.csv\" val polygonRDDStartOffset = 0 // The coordinates start from Column 0 val polygonRDDEndOffset = 9 // The coordinates end at Column 9 val polygonRDDSplitter = FileDataSplitter . CSV val carryOtherAttributes = true // Carry Column 10 (hotel, gas, bar...) var objectRDD = new PolygonRDD ( sc , polygonRDDInputLocation , polygonRDDStartOffset , polygonRDDEndOffset , polygonRDDSplitter , carryOtherAttributes ) If the data file is in TSV format, just simply use the following line to replace the old FileDataSplitter: val polygonRDDSplitter = FileDataSplitter . TSV The way to create a LineStringRDD is the same as PolygonRDD. Create a generic SpatialRDD (behavoir changed in v1.2.0) \u00b6 A generic SpatialRDD is not typed to a certain geometry type and open to more scenarios. It allows an input data file contains mixed types of geometries. For instance, a WKT file contains three types gemetries LineString , Polygon and MultiPolygon . From WKT/WKB \u00b6 Geometries in a WKT and WKB file always occupy a single column no matter how many coordinates they have. Therefore, creating a typed SpatialRDD is easy. Suppose we have a checkin.tsv WKT TSV file at Path /Download/checkin.tsv as follows: POINT (-88.331492 32.324142) hotel POINT (-88.175933 32.360763) gas POINT (-88.388954 32.357073) bar POINT (-88.221102 32.35078) restaurant This file has two columns and corresponding offsets (Column IDs) are 0, 1. Column 0 is the WKT string and Column 1 is the checkin business type.

Assume you have a shape file called myShapefile , the file structure should be like this: - shapefile1 - shapefile2 - myshapefile - myshapefile.shp - myshapefile.shx - myshapefile.dbf - myshapefile... - ... If the file you are reading contains non-ASCII characters you'll need to explicitly set the encoding via geospark.global.charset system property before the call to ShapefileReader.readToGeometryRDD . Example: System . setProperty ( \"geospark.global.charset\" , \"utf8\" ) From SparkSQL DataFrame \u00b6 To create a generic SpatialRDD from CSV, TSV, WKT, WKB and GeoJSON input formats, you can use GeoSparkSQL. Make sure you include the full dependencies of GeoSpark. Read GeoSparkSQL API . We use checkin.csv CSV file as the example. You can create a generic SpatialRDD using the following steps: Load data in GeoSparkSQL. var df = sparkSession . read . format ( \"csv\" ). option ( \"header\" , \"false\" ). load ( csvPointInputLocation ) df . createOrReplaceTempView ( \"inputtable\" ) Create a Geometry type column in GeoSparkSQL var spatialDf = sparkSession . sql ( \"\"\" |SELECT ST_Point(CAST(inputtable._c0 AS Decimal(24,20)),CAST(inputtable._c1 AS Decimal(24,20))) AS checkin |FROM inputtable \"\"\" . stripMargin ) Use GeoSparkSQL DataFrame-RDD Adapter to convert a DataFrame to an SpatialRDD var spatialRDD = new SpatialRDD [ Geometry ] spatialRDD . rawSpatialRDD = Adapter . toRdd ( spatialDf ) For WKT/WKB/GeoJSON data, please use ST_GeomFromWKT / ST_GeomFromWKB / ST_GeomFromGeoJSON instead. Transform the Coordinate Reference System \u00b6 GeoSpark doesn't control the coordinate unit (degree-based or meter-based) of all geometries in an SpatialRDD. The unit of all related distances in GeoSpark is same as the unit of all geometries in an SpatialRDD. To convert Coordinate Reference System of an SpatialRDD, use the following code: val sourceCrsCode = \"epsg:4326\" // WGS84, the most common degree-based CRS val targetCrsCode = \"epsg:3857\" // The most common meter-based CRS objectRDD . CRSTransform ( sourceCrsCode , targetCrsCode ) Warning CRS transformation should be done right after creating each SpatialRDD, otherwise it will lead to wrong query results. For instace, use something like this: var objectRDD = new PointRDD ( sc , pointRDDInputLocation , pointRDDOffset , pointRDDSplitter , carryOtherAttributes ) objectRDD . CRSTransform ( \"epsg:4326\" , \"epsg:3857\" ) The details CRS information can be found on EPSG.io Read other attributes in an SpatialRDD \u00b6 Each SpatialRDD can carry non-spatial attributes such as price, age and name as long as the user sets carryOtherAttributes as TRUE . The other attributes are combined together to a string and stored in UserData field of each geometry. To retrieve the UserData field, use the following code: val rddWithOtherAttributes = objectRDD . rawSpatialRDD . rdd . map [ String ]( f => f . getUserData . asInstanceOf [ String ]) Write a Spatial Range Query \u00b6 A spatial range query takes as input a range query window and an SpatialRDD and returns all geometries that intersect / are fully covered by the query window. Assume you now have an SpatialRDD (typed or generic). You can use the following code to issue an Spatial Range Query on it. val rangeQueryWindow = new Envelope (- 90.01 , - 80.01 , 30.01 , 40.01 ) val considerBoundaryIntersection = false // Only return gemeotries fully covered by the window val usingIndex = false var queryResult = RangeQuery . SpatialRangeQuery ( spatialRDD , rangeQueryWindow , considerBoundaryIntersection , usingIndex ) considerBoundaryIntersection can be set to TRUE to return all geometries intersect with query window. Note Spatial range query is equal to ST_Within and ST_Intersects in Spatial SQL. An example query is as follows: SELECT * FROM checkin WHERE ST_Intersects ( queryWindow , checkin . location ) Range query window \u00b6 Besides the rectangle (Envelope) type range query window, GeoSpark range query window can be Point/Polygon/LineString. The code to create a point is as follows: val geometryFactory = new GeometryFactory () val pointObject = geometryFactory . createPoint ( new Coordinate (- 84.01 , 34.01 )) The code to create a polygon (with 4 vertexes) is as follows: val geometryFactory = new GeometryFactory () val coordinates = new Array [ Coordinate ]( 5 ) coordinates ( 0 ) = new Coordinate ( 0 , 0 ) coordinates ( 1 ) = new Coordinate ( 0 , 4 ) coordinates ( 2 ) = new Coordinate ( 4 , 4 ) coordinates ( 3 ) = new Coordinate ( 4 , 0 ) coordinates ( 4 ) = coordinates ( 0 ) // The last coordinate is the same as the first coordinate in order to compose a closed ring val polygonObject = geometryFactory . createPolygon ( coordinates ) The code to create a line string (with 4 vertexes) is as follows: val geometryFactory = new GeometryFactory () val coordinates = new Array [ Coordinate ]( 4 ) coordinates ( 0 ) = new Coordinate ( 0 , 0 ) coordinates ( 1 ) = new Coordinate ( 0 , 4 ) coordinates ( 2 ) = new Coordinate ( 4 , 4 ) coordinates ( 3 ) = new Coordinate ( 4 , 0 ) val linestringObject = geometryFactory . createLineString ( coordinates ) Use spatial indexes \u00b6 GeoSpark provides two types of spatial indexes, Quad-Tree and R-Tree. Once you specify an index type, GeoSpark will build a local tree index on each of the SpatialRDD partition. To utilize a spatial index in a spatial range query, use the following code: val rangeQueryWindow = new Envelope (- 90.01 , - 80.01 , 30.01 , 40.01 ) val considerBoundaryIntersection = false // Only return gemeotries fully covered by the window val buildOnSpatialPartitionedRDD = false // Set to TRUE only if run join query spatialRDD . buildIndex ( IndexType . QUADTREE , buildOnSpatialPartitionedRDD ) val usingIndex = true var queryResult = RangeQuery . SpatialRangeQuery ( spatialRDD , rangeQueryWindow , considerBoundaryIntersection , usingIndex ) Tip Using an index might not be the best choice all the time because building index also takes time. A spatial index is very useful when your data is complex polygons and line strings. Output format \u00b6 The output format of the spatial range query is another SpatialRDD. Write a Spatial KNN Query \u00b6 A spatial K Nearnest Neighbor query takes as input a K, a query point and an SpatialRDD and finds the K geometries in the RDD which are the closest to he query point. Assume you now have an SpatialRDD (typed or generic). You can use the following code to issue an Spatial KNN Query on it. val geometryFactory = new GeometryFactory () val pointObject = geometryFactory . createPoint ( new Coordinate (- 84.01 , 34.01 )) val K = 1000 // K Nearest Neighbors val usingIndex = false val result = KNNQuery . SpatialKnnQuery ( objectRDD , pointObject , K , usingIndex ) Note Spatial KNN query that returns 5 Nearest Neighbors is equal to the following statement in Spatial SQL SELECT ck . name , ck . rating , ST_Distance ( ck . location , myLocation ) AS distance FROM checkins ck ORDER BY distance DESC LIMIT 5 Query center geometry \u00b6 Besides the Point type, GeoSpark KNN query center can be Polygon and LineString. To learn how to create Polygon and LineString object, see Range query window . Use spatial indexes \u00b6 To utilize a spatial index in a spatial KNN query, use the following code: val geometryFactory = new GeometryFactory () val pointObject = geometryFactory . createPoint ( new Coordinate (- 84.01 , 34.01 )) val K = 1000 // K Nearest Neighbors val buildOnSpatialPartitionedRDD = false // Set to TRUE only if run join query objectRDD . buildIndex ( IndexType . RTREE , buildOnSpatialPartitionedRDD ) val usingIndex = true val result = KNNQuery . SpatialKnnQuery ( objectRDD , pointObject , K , usingIndex ) Warning Only R-Tree index supports Spatial KNN query Output format \u00b6 The output format of the spatial KNN query is a list of geometries. The list has K geometry objects. Write a Spatial Join Query \u00b6 A spatial join query takes as input two Spatial RDD A and B. For each geometry in A, finds the geometries (from B) covered/intersected by it. A and B can be any geometry type and are not necessary to have the same geometry type. Assume you now have two SpatialRDDs (typed or generic). You can use the following code to issue an Spatial Join Query on them. val considerBoundaryIntersection = false // Only return gemeotries fully covered by each query window in queryWindowRDD val usingIndex = false objectRDD . analyze () objectRDD . spatialPartitioning ( GridType . KDBTREE ) queryWindowRDD . spatialPartitioning ( objectRDD . getPartitioner ) val result = JoinQuery . SpatialJoinQuery ( objectRDD , queryWindowRDD , usingIndex , considerBoundaryIntersection ) Note Spatial join query is equal to the following query in Spatial SQL: SELECT superhero . name FROM city , superhero WHERE ST_Contains ( city . geom , superhero . geom ); Find the super heros in each city Use spatial partitioning \u00b6 GeoSpark spatial partitioning method can significantly speed up the join query. Three spatial partitioning methods are available: KDB-Tree, Quad-Tree and R-Tree. Two SpatialRDD must be partitioned by the same way. If you first partition SpatialRDD A, then you must use the partitioner of A to partition B. objectRDD . spatialPartitioning ( GridType . KDBTREE ) queryWindowRDD . spatialPartitioning ( objectRDD . getPartitioner ) Or queryWindowRDD . spatialPartitioning ( GridType . KDBTREE ) objectRDD . spatialPartitioning ( queryWindowRDD . getPartitioner ) Use spatial indexes \u00b6 To utilize a spatial index in a spatial join query, use the following code: objectRDD . spatialPartitioning ( joinQueryPartitioningType ) queryWindowRDD . spatialPartitioning ( objectRDD . getPartitioner ) val buildOnSpatialPartitionedRDD = true // Set to TRUE only if run join query val usingIndex = true queryWindowRDD . buildIndex ( IndexType . QUADTREE , buildOnSpatialPartitionedRDD ) val result = JoinQuery . SpatialJoinQueryFlat ( objectRDD , queryWindowRDD , usingIndex , considerBoundaryIntersection ) The index should be built on either one of two SpatialRDDs. In general, you should build it on the larger SpatialRDD. Output format \u00b6 The output format of the spatial join query is a PairRDD. In this PairRDD, each object is a pair of two geometries. The left one is the geometry from objectRDD and the right one is the geometry from the queryWindowRDD. Point,Polygon Point,Polygon Point,Polygon Polygon,Polygon LineString,LineString Polygon,LineString ... Each object on the left is covered/intersected by the object on the right. Write a Distance Join Query \u00b6 A distance join query takes as input two Spatial RDD A and B and a distance. For each geometry in A, finds the geometries (from B) are within the given distance to it. A and B can be any geometry type and are not necessary to have the same geometry type. The unit of the distance is explained here . Assume you now have two SpatialRDDs (typed or generic). You can use the following code to issue an Distance Join Query on them. objectRddA . analyze () val circleRDD = new CircleRDD ( objectRddA , 0.1 ) // Create a CircleRDD using the given distance circleRDD . spatialPartitioning ( GridType . KDBTREE ) objectRddB . spatialPartitioning ( circleRDD . getPartitioner ) val considerBoundaryIntersection = false // Only return gemeotries fully covered by each query window in queryWindowRDD val usingIndex = false val result = JoinQuery . DistanceJoinQueryFlat ( objectRddB , circleRDD , usingIndex , considerBoundaryIntersection ) The rest part of the join query is same as the spatial join query. The details of spatial partitioning in join query is here . The details of using spatial indexes in join query is here . The output format of the distance join query is here . Note Distance join query is equal to the following query in Spatial SQL: SELECT superhero . name FROM city , superhero WHERE ST_Distance ( city . geom , superhero . geom ) <= 10 ; Find the super heros within 10 miles of each city Save to permanent storage \u00b6 You can always save an SpatialRDD back to some permanent storage such as HDFS and Amazon S3. You can save distributed SpatialRDD to WKT, GeoJSON and object files. Note Non-spatial attributes such as price, age and name will also be stored to permanent storage. Save an SpatialRDD (not indexed) \u00b6 Typed SpatialRDD and generic SpatialRDD can be saved to permanent storage. Save to distributed WKT text file \u00b6 Use the following code to save an SpatialRDD as a distributed WKT text file: objectRDD . rawSpatialRDD . saveAsTextFile ( \"hdfs://PATH\" ) objectRDD . saveAsWKT ( \"hdfs://PATH\" ) Save to distributed WKB text file \u00b6 Use the following code to save an SpatialRDD as a distributed WKB text file: objectRDD . saveAsWKB ( \"hdfs://PATH\" ) Save to distributed GeoJSON text file \u00b6 Use the following code to save an SpatialRDD as a distributed GeoJSON text file: objectRDD . saveAsGeoJSON ( \"hdfs://PATH\" ) Save to distributed object file \u00b6 Use the following code to save an SpatialRDD as a distributed object file: objectRDD . rawSpatialRDD . saveAsObjectFile ( \"hdfs://PATH\" ) Note Each object in a distributed object file is a byte array (not human-readable). This byte array is the serialized format of a Geometry or a SpatialIndex. Save an SpatialRDD (indexed) \u00b6 Indexed typed SpatialRDD and generic SpatialRDD can be saved to permanent storage. However, the indexed SpatialRDD has to be stored as a distributed object file. Save to distributed object file \u00b6 Use the following code to save an SpatialRDD as a distributed object file: objectRDD.indexedRawRDD.saveAsObjectFile(\"hdfs://PATH\") Save an SpatialRDD (spatialPartitioned W/O indexed) \u00b6 A spatial partitioned RDD can be saved to permanent storage but Spark is not able to maintain the same RDD partition Id of the original RDD. This will lead to wrong join query results. We are working on some solutions. Stay tuned! Reload a saved SpatialRDD \u00b6 You can easily reload an SpatialRDD that has been saved to a distributed object file . Load to a typed SpatialRDD \u00b6 Use the following code to reload the PointRDD/PolygonRDD/LineStringRDD: var savedRDD = new PointRDD ( sc . objectFile [ Point ]( \"hdfs://PATH\" )) var savedRDD = new PointRDD ( sc . objectFile [ Polygon ]( \"hdfs://PATH\" )) var savedRDD = new PointRDD ( sc . objectFile [ LineString ]( \"hdfs://PATH\" )) Load to a generic SpatialRDD \u00b6 Use the following code to reload the SpatialRDD: var savedRDD = new SpatialRDD [ Geometry ] savedRDD . rawSpatialRDD = sc . objectFile [ Geometry ]( \"hdfs://PATH\" ) Use the following code to reload the indexed SpatialRDD: var savedRDD = new SpatialRDD [ Geometry ] savedRDD . indexedRawRDD = sc . objectFile [ SpatialIndex ]( \"hdfs://PATH\" )","title":"Spatial RDD application"},{"location":"tutorial/rdd/#set-up-dependencies","text":"Read GeoSpark Maven Central coordinates Select the minimum dependencies : Add Apache Spark (only the Spark core) and GeoSpark (core).

Save to permanent storage \u00b6 To save a Spatial DataFrame to some permanent storage such as Hive tables and HDFS, you can simply convert each geometry in the Geometry type column back to a plain String and save the plain DataFrame to wherever you want. Use the following code to convert the Geometry column in a DataFrame back to a WKT string column: sparkSession . udf . register ( \"ST_SaveAsWKT\" , ( geometry : Geometry ) => ( geometry . toText )) var stringDf = sparkSession . sql ( \"\"\" |SELECT ST_SaveAsWKT(countyshape) |FROM polygondf \"\"\" . stripMargin ) Note We are working on providing more user-friendly output functions such as ST_SaveAsWKT and ST_SaveAsWKB .

The example code is written in Scala but also works for Java . Starting from 1.2.0, GeoSparkViz provides the DataFrame support. This offers users a more flexible way to design beautiful map visualization effects including scatter plots and heat maps. In the meantime, GeoSparkViz RDD API remains the same. Note All GeoSparkViz SQL/DataFrame APIs are explained in GeoSparkViz API . Why scalable map visualization? \u00b6 Data visualization allows users to summarize, analyze and reason about data. Guaranteeing detailed and accurate geospatial map visualization (e.g., at multiple zoom levels) requires extremely high-resolution maps. Classic visualization solutions such as Google Maps, MapBox and ArcGIS suffer from limited computation resources and hence take a tremendous amount of time to generate maps for large-scale geospatial data. In big spatial data scenarios, these tools just crash or run forever. GeoSparkViz encapsulates the main steps of map visualization process, e.g., pixelize, aggregate, and render, into a set of massively parallelized GeoViz operators and the user can assemble any customized styles. Visualize SpatialRDD \u00b6 This tutorial mainly focuses on explaining SQL/DataFrame API. GeoSparkViz RDD example can be found in GeoSpark template project . Set up dependencies \u00b6 Read GeoSpark Maven Central coordinates Add Apache Spark core , Apache SparkSQL , GeoSpark core , GeoSparkSQL , GeoSparkViz Initiate SparkSession \u00b6 Use the following code to initiate your SparkSession at the beginning: This will register GeoSparkVizKryo serializer. var sparkSession = SparkSession . builder () . master ( \"local[*]\" ) // Delete this if run in cluster mode . appName ( \"readTestScala\" ) // Change this to a proper name // Enable GeoSpark custom Kryo serializer . config ( \"spark.serializer\" , classOf [ KryoSerializer ]. getName ) . config ( \"spark.kryo.registrator\" , classOf [ GeoSparkVizKryoRegistrator ]. getName ) . getOrCreate () Register GeoSparkSQL and GeoSparkViz \u00b6 Add the following line after your SparkSession declaration GeoSparkSQLRegistrator . registerAll ( sparkSession ) GeoSparkVizRegistrator . registerAll ( sparkSession ) This will register all User Defined Tyeps, functions and optimizations in GeoSparkSQL and GeoSparkViz. Create Spatial DataFrame \u00b6 There is a DataFrame as follows: +----------+---------+ | _c0| _c1| +----------+---------+ |-88.331492|32.324142| |-88.175933|32.360763| |-88.388954|32.357073| |-88.221102| 32.35078| You first need to create a Geometry type column. CREATE OR REPLACE TEMP VIEW pointtable AS SELECT ST_Point ( cast ( pointtable . _c0 as Decimal ( 24 , 20 )), cast ( pointtable . _c1 as Decimal ( 24 , 20 ))) as shape FROM pointtable As you know, GeoSpark provides many different methods to load various spatial data formats. Please read Write an Spatial DataFrame application . Generate a single image \u00b6 In most cases, you just want to see a single image out of your spatial dataset. Pixelize spatial objects \u00b6 To put spatial objects on a map image, you first need to convert them to pixels. First, compute the spatial boundary of this column. CREATE OR REPLACE TEMP VIEW boundtable AS SELECT ST_Envelope_Aggr ( shape ) as bound FROM pointtable Then use ST_Pixelize to conver them to pixels. CREATE OR REPLACE TEMP VIEW pixels AS SELECT pixel , shape FROM pointtable LATERAL VIEW ST_Pixelize ( ST_Transform ( shape , 'epsg:4326' , 'epsg:3857' ), 256 , 256 , ( SELECT ST_Transform ( bound , 'epsg:4326' , 'epsg:3857' ) FROM boundtable )) AS pixel This will give you a 256*256 resolution image after you run ST_Render at the end of this tutorial. Warning We highly suggest that you should use ST_Transform to transfrom coordiantes to a visualization-specific coordinate sysmte such as epsg:3857. Otherwise you map may look distorted. Aggregate pixels \u00b6 Many objects may be pixelized to the same pixel locations. You now need to aggregate them based on either their spatial aggregation or spatial observations such as temperature or humidity. CREATE OR REPLACE TEMP VIEW pixelaggregates AS SELECT pixel , count ( * ) as weight FROM pixels GROUP BY pixel The weight indicates the degree of spatial aggregation or spatial observations. Later on, it will determine the color of this pixel. Colorize pixels \u00b6 Run the following command to assign colors for pixels based on their weights. CREATE OR REPLACE TEMP VIEW pixelaggregates AS SELECT pixel , ST_Colorize ( weight , ( SELECT max ( weight ) FROM pixelaggregates )) as color FROM pixelaggregates Please read ST_Colorize for a detailed API description. Render the image \u00b6 Use ST_Render to plot all pixels on a single image. CREATE OR REPLACE TEMP VIEW images AS SELECT ST_Render ( pixel , color ) AS image , ( SELECT ST_AsText ( bound ) FROM boundtable ) AS boundary FROM pixelaggregates This DataFrame will contain a Image type column which has only one image. Store the image on disk \u00b6 Fetch the image from the previous DataFrame var image = sparkSession.table(\"images\").take(1)(0)(0).asInstanceOf[ImageSerializableWrapper].getImage Use GeoSparkViz ImageGenerator to store this image on disk. var imageGenerator = new ImageGenerator imageGenerator . SaveRasterImageAsLocalFile ( image , System . getProperty ( \"user.dir\" )+ \"/target/points\" , ImageType . PNG ) Generate map tiles \u00b6 If you are a map tile professional, you may need to generate map tiles for different zoom levels and eventually create the map tile layer. Pixelization and pixel aggregation \u00b6 Please first do pixelization and pixel aggregation using the same commands in single image generation. In ST_Pixelize, you need specify a very high resolution. Create tile name \u00b6 Run the following command to compute the tile name for every pixels CREATE OR REPLACE TEMP VIEW pixelaggregates AS SELECT pixel , weight , ST_TileName ( pixel , 3 ) AS pid FROM pixelaggregates \"3\" is the zoom level for these map tiles. Colorize pixels \u00b6 Use the same command explained in single image generation to assign colors. Render map tiles \u00b6 You now need to group pixels by tiles and then render map tile images in parallel. CREATE OR REPLACE TEMP VIEW images AS SELECT ST_Render ( pixel , color ) AS image FROM pixelaggregates GROUP BY pid Store map tiles on disk \u00b6 You can use the same commands in single image generation to fetch all map tiles and store them one by one.","title":"Visualize Spatial DataFrame"},{"location":"tutorial/viz/#why-scalable-map-visualization","text":"Data visualization allows users to summarize, analyze and reason about data. Guaranteeing detailed and accurate geospatial map visualization (e.g., at multiple zoom levels) requires extremely high-resolution maps.
